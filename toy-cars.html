                <p>I have wanted to make more wooden toys for my kid, and after purchasing a used scroll saw, I was able to make a couple of toy cars like this out of some scrap elm I had in the shop.  I had bought the wheels from a wood supply shop in Portland on a visit, although I think any chain craft store might have them.  </p>
<p>I ended up making two, the one pictured below, and a newer one with a few small issues addressed.  The length of the axles and the roundness of the axle holes is critical to get them to roll well, the second car I made works much better.  The photo of the car being finished shows how I messed up drilling the hole for the front axle, it is not quite round.  The second car also had some paste wax applied to the inside of the axle holes before assembly.  </p>
<p>One remaining issue is the size of these cars - they ended up being just a little too big for my kid to play with when I made them (around 18 months old).  I would reduce the size by about a third in all dimensions if I ever make more of these.  The wheels already look a little too big, but I think having them be a more managable size would make them more fun to play with.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I got rid of the scroll saw --  I had bought it used, without any blades.  As the owner demonstrated it and told me his mother-in-law had used it for some crafts, I thought it was good to go.  After getting it home and set up, I noticed a few parts showed some damage to the blade holder that made it rattle when in use, and difficult to tension.  As a result I broke quite a few blades trying to complete these toy cars and another project.  I might have been able to craft a few replacement parts, but decided it was a better use of my time to practice with a coping or turning saw for these kinds of projects.</p>
