                </h2>

                
                

                <p><em>(This post is very much a work-in-progress when posted, and I mostly wrote up from my notes on configuring the box)</em></p>
<p>I've been wanting to set up a couple of projects that would be best served by something like a Raspberry Pi - lightweight processes that are always on.  Unfortunately, they're impossible to find.  I had been considering replacing my TV computer (really my spouse's old laptop) with an Android/Chromecast device, and after a little research I found a review of <a class="external" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/onn-android-tv-uhd-review-too-buggy-to-recommend">one sold by Walmart for $20</a>.  That lead me to the question every nerd should ask when they see a device that cheap... does it run Linux?  I didn't find an answer to that question, but I found many similar generic Android TV boxes for sale on various websites.  Surely those run Linux, and of course they do.  </p>
<p>(Side note: I've variously tried to run <a class="internal" href="meteor-scatter-station.html">my ham projects</a> on <a class="internal" href="ham-radio-in-wsl.html">WSL</a> and not had much luck on my <em>old</em> Windows 10 machine.  Remote GUI was a pain, and Linux audio is <em>always</em> a difficulty.  So back to a dedicated Linux box.)</p>
<p>There are a variety of these, powered by a number of SoC processors, <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian">but the Amlogic S9xx series seems well supported by the Armbian project</a>, and readily available.  (Note: After ordering this board, I found <a class="external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24905592">some concerns</a> about <a class="external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28891658">Armbian's practices</a>.)</p>
<p>After searching for various devices and comparing specifications with prices, I decided to <a class="external" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/788306507">buy one for around $30</a> that included 64GB eMMC storage and 4GB RAM, but only 100M ethernet.  For $30, this should be sufficient for my ham shack machine, and maybe enough to run a few other services.  Following their <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian#install-to-emmc-and-update-instructions">instructions</a>, and <a class="external" href="https://i12bretro.github.io/tutorials/0269.html">these extra steps</a> to configure booting.  </p>
<h1>Boot configuration</h1>
<p>My model wasn't specifically listed (Sunisery H96 Max, says s905x2 CPU with 4G RAM), a similar sounding "X96 MAX" was available, so I ended up trying this dtb file: <code>meson-g12a-x96-max.dtb</code>.  It seems to work.  When trying to reboot the TV box into linux, don't forget to hit the reset button (inside the AV port) to enable multiboot.</p>
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>Now that I have Linux booting on this device, I can work towards the following
- WSJT-X configuration with SDR for 6m/VHF reception
- Shack Control box to remotely turn on radio and run remote antenna switch.
- APRS iGate with KISS TNC, GPS module, old 2m radio?</p>
<h1>Concerns</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Ethernet not functional</em>: Have not investigated this one yet.</li>
<li><em>Unable to change passwords</em>:  Solution - I just needed to use <code>sudo passwd</code> from my account.</li>
<li><em>Long term support of Armbian?</em>: Armbian states that their mission is to extend support for these unsupported ARM SoCs, which I greatly appreciate.  I feel like I've been burned on dev boards going out of support before, so I'm still a little worried.</li>
<li><em>Power draw from small power supply</em>:  Plugging in my Griffin iMic USB sound card works fine.  A beefier USB sound card (with RCA inputs and several more channels) appeared to draw too much power.  I have a powered USB 2.0 hub that I should test it with.</li>
</ul>

                    <a href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/ham-radio-in-wsl.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Ham Radio in WSL&quot;">Ham Radio in WSL</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I have been trying to run my ham radio programs in WSL lately.  I've poked around with WSL in the past to run a media servers, but never looked into it much in regards to hardware or porgrams with a GUI.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a good SDR receiver software for Windows that will interface via audio with "soundcard" mode software, such as the WSJT-X.</p>
<p>So, I'm running my shack on an old (circa 2010-2012) gaming desktop that is stuck on Windows 10.  I'd still like to play games on it, and I currently use the Windows side as a fileserver for backups.  As a result, I don't want to boot into Linux just to keep a ham receiver running overnight. </p>
<p>Of course, an easier answer would be put move all this to a remote linux box running on a lower powered SBC. The downsides to that are that it costs money (and boy are Raspberry Pis expensive these days), and it's one more device to administer, whereas this experimentation only costs time.</p>
<p>I figure I'll need to make the following WSL features work to use it for ham radio:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDR receiver requires support for <a class="external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb">USB devices</a>, requires <a class="external" href="https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/wiki/WSL-support">building the kernel from source for Windows 10</a></li>
<li>WSL running <a class="external" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/running-wsl-gui-apps-on-windows-10/ba-p/1493242">GUI through Xming</a></li>
<li>installed SoapySDR support for the RTLSDR dongle, and CubicSDR software</li>
<li>SoapySDR requires <a class="external" href="https://itectec.com/superuser/linux-how-to-get-mdns-avahi-to-work-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">Avahi, which doesn't work out of the box.</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>I've tested these on my Windows 11 tablet, where I'm now stuck on SoapySDR/CubicSDR finding the RTLSDR receiver but not appearing to actually pull data from it.  Now I need to try these steps again on my Windows 10 desktop.  I'm stuck on the GUI working from there, I think I need to experiment with X Forwarding next.</p>
<p>Once I have those features working, I plan on testing WSJT-X and CubicSDR (which relies on SoapySDR).</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I bought a DDS-60 VFO board from <a class="external" href="https://midnightdesignsolutions.com/dds60/">Midnight Design Solutions</a> almost a decade ago, with the intent of using it to build a HF antenna analyzer.  I built an Arduino shield to hold it, but never got around to the RF power meters required to use it as an antenna analyzer.  </p>
<p>In the summer of 2020, during wildfire season and sociall distancing due to COVID, I was assembling a <a class="external" href="https://qrpkits.com/tribander.html">KD1JV Tri-Bander CW tranceiver kit</a> that a neighbor had bought and not finished.  I am not sure that the upper and lower band filters were working correctly, as the radio was totally deaf and putting out zero power.  I briefly got out the Arduino DDS-60 sheild that I had built to help diagnose the issue, and <a class="external" href="https://github.com/indiahotelxray/dds60-siggen">wrote a control program</a> to switch between bands.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>The front panel has room for two buttons, a rotary encoder with a push button built in, and the display.  The two buttons and push button on the rotary encoder.  On the rear panel, the Arduino's USB port and power supply are available, along with three of the analog pins broken out with RCA connectors for future use.</p>
<p>I designed four modes for the device, selectable by using one of the push buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal Generator: Produces a output at a single frequency.</li>
<li>Sweep: Sweeps across a range of frequencies automatically.</li>
<li>VFO: same as signal generator mode, but limited to ham bands, with a button to jump between bands.</li>
<li>Memory: recalls specific frequencies from the EEPROM.  These can be saved via a serial protocol (untested).</li>
</ul>
<p>The rotary encoder changes the frequency, or the start for the sweep mode.  Pressing the button on the rotary encoder changes the step size when the encoder is turned.</p>
<p>The second push button can provide an additional function for each mode.  In VFO mode, it switches bands, while in signal generator mode, it increments the frequency by 1 MHz.</p>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago, my ham neighbor who gave me the tranceiver kit was also clearing out his shack and gave me a number of items, including an old serial port switch that was just the right size to turn into a case.   This box came with front and back panels that could be removed entirely from the case, making them particularly easy to work with, and I initially had planned to just flip them around to hide the text.  I manually laid out the panels by tracing the panels on a sheet of paper and then trying to trace the components in their locations, trying to reuse or expand existing holes where possible.</p>
<p>The holes I drilled are sloppy, as I am not much of a machinist, but they'll work for this.  Particularly cutting out the square hole for the screen was difficult, using a dremel tool cut-off blade to quite a while.  After drilling, I took a light grinding bit and buffing bit to clean up any sharp edges.</p>
<p>I  spray-painted the panels a black paint that I had sitting around, unfortunately, it beads up to create a hammered metal look, and that resulted in a splotchy looking finish.  Maybe not the best look for this panel, but it's the paint I had on hand and was better than the scratched up white paint from my amateur machining.</p>
<p><img alt="vfo case inside after painting" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\vfo_case_insidea.jpg"></p>
<p>Before adding leads to the components, I test fit it all in the case.  At this point, I managed to mess up the finish a tiny bit by needing to drill an additional hole for the pin that keeps the rotary encoder in place.</p>

<p><img alt="vfo case test assembled" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\vfo_case_assembeled_offa.jpg"></p>
<h3>Additional hardware</h3>
<p>I need to finish wiring up the display, buttons, and rotary encoder.  It appears that Arduino has built in pull-up resistors, so wiring the buttons should be a matter of connecting to a digital pin and ground.</p>
<h2>Software changes to make.</h2>
<p>The Arduino sketch I am using resides on my <a class="external" href="https://github.com/indiahotelxray/dds60-siggen">github account here</a>.  I've started fixing some things now that I plan to actually put it into a case, not just use it as a breadboard and mess of wires.</p>
<h3>Rotary encoder</h3>
<p>I need to try using one of the Arduino rotary encoder libraries.  I had not tested with the rotary encoder yet, just a pair of pushbuttons and assumed the rotary encoder would behave the same.  This appears to not be the case.</p>
<h3>Display library</h3>
<p>I need to test this software with the display I am using.  Before having a case for this, I had burned out the Adafruit SSD1306 I2C OLED display I was using.  To complete the project, I switched to a standard HD44780-style display I had laying around.  This will require quite a few more pins to control, and need to switch out the library used.  On the other hand, this appears to save significant memory space, as the Adafruit OLED board used a buffer in memory instead of sending text to the display.</p>
<h3>Fixing warnings</h3>
<p>Much of the functionality beyond the basic signal generator function has not been thoroughly tested, and after my most recent look at the code, I saw it was generating an error about copying the memory string name and a bunch of type conversion warnings.  These took a few minutes to fix after googling to fill in my lack of C++ knowledge.  There is still one warning about an unusued variable for the maximum memory slot, which I'll need to go back and ensure the memory mode loops through frequencies correctly.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I've been trying to operate my HF radio station remotely for the last month, using Windows Remote Desktop and <a class="external" href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a> to sit and make some FT8 contacts while drinking my morning coffee.  This has worked well but I want to remove the step of having to remember to turn off my radio when I am done.  The power supply and radio are mounted in a closed cabinet.  Leaving the cabinet open invites exploration by our feline companion, while leaving it shut and powered up for long periods of time may result in the temperature rising more than I want.</p>
<p>I ordered a simple relay board and decided to put it inside of my power supply, to be triggered by a program on the computer to turn the station on and off.  West Mountain Radio sells <a class="external" href="https://www.westmountainradio.com/product_info.php?products_id=rr_4005i">a network connected control and monitor system</a> with Power Pole connectors that would be great for this, but it's also $280 which is a lot more than I want to spend for this little effort.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>Last weekend after getting all the parts, I took a few moments out in my shop to drill out some holes and mount the relay board, and wire the relay into the circuit of the power supply.  I had selected a relay that is adequate for the AC side of the power supply, which are more commonly available on a premade board than those capable of handling 12V/25A.  I made a few mistakes wiring it up, first mistakenly wiring it in series with the light inside the switch, and then wiring it to be normally closed when the relay is not powered.  </p>
<p><img alt="relay mounted in power supply" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_insidea.jpg">.
<img alt="relay close up" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_relay_closeupa.jpg">.</p>
<p>The final mistake I made was wiring up connector that I put on the back of my power supply.  I had decided to use a 1/8" TRS connector to provide power, ground, and signal to the relay from the control board, but instead of soldering to the tip and ring pins, I soldered to pins used to indicate when the plug is removed!  I connected ground to the shield, power to the ring, and signal to the tip, figuring this would ensure the least bad results if any of the pins made contact while inserting the plug.</p>
<p><img alt="bad plug wiring" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_plug_to_fixa.jpg"></p>
<p>After fixing the misconnected pins on the TRS socket, I needed to wire this up to my computer somehow.  My temporary solution is to use an old Arduino (which has been flaky to program) to provide +5V and ground to power the relay whenever my computer is connected to it.  Longer term, I am planning to develop a shack control board and software that can use an Arduino or similar board to monitor and control several aspects of my shack.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Design</h2>
<p>I wanted a remote antenna switch, and commercial models seem to be expensive relative to what I am willing to spend.  I planned to combine an Arduino, ethernet shield with power over ethernet, and a board with four relays.  This assumes that commonly available relay boards would work fine for switching HF signals, providing both adequate isolation (separation when an antenna is turned off) and have minimal losses when in use.  I had planned to add on remote control for an automatic antenna tuner and an antenna rotator, but those two features will be for some future iteration of the project.  I have at least two HF antennas I wanted to connect, a short G5RV and a two element 6M beam.</p>
<h3>Micrcontroller</h3>
<p>After running into issues with a standard Arduino Uno and ethernet shield - there wasn't enough memory to serve up a minimal HTML page via HTTP to control the switch.  I looked at some successful projects using networked Arduinos for remote control, like the <a class="external" href="https://opensprinkler.com/">OpenSprinkler</a>, finding the source code was more optimized than I thought I could get for a one-off hobby project.</p>
<p>Next idea was to look at something like the Arduino Yún, which I discovered was unavailable at tthe time.  I did find Adafruit selling a clone called the <a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3034">Seeeduino Cloud</a>, marked as compatible with the Yún, and bought a <a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3785">Power over Ethernet (POE)</a>.  I would not recommend the Seeeduino Cloud as it uses a custom branch of the OpenWRT Linux distribution that several years since having any kind of update, and minimal documentation.  So I set up two parts - a static HTML page with JavaScript for interactivity, served up by the Seeeduino's Linux side, and used the Arduino YunBridge library with a REST API to turn the appropriate pins for each relay on and off.  It works <em>okay</em>, but can be a bit buggy when the Arduino loses it's connection.</p>
<h3>Relay board</h3>
<p>I mounted a <a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/4-channel-5v-relay-module">Sainsmart relay board</a> and Seeeduino into an old project box I had bought years ago for a manual antenna switch and never implemented.  I built a small RF sheild around the relay board using an old piece of aluminum bent to fit around it, and wired it up using some speaker wire and panel mount <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_connector">SO239 connectors</a></p>
<p>I had considered their relay board with a <a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/rj45-tcp-ip-remote-control-board-with-integrated-8-ch-relay">built-in web server</a>, but this was out of stock at the time.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I can't tell if there is <em>any</em> isolation between these.  I used a friend's NanoVNA to find minimal losses on each of the connectors when selected, but I cannot hear any difference between connectors on the radio with one antenna hooked up.</p>
<p>My next steps will be to rewire the relay board to directly solder to the PCB with short stubs of 14 gage copper wire to each connector and see if this works better.</p>
<h2>Antenna Rotator?</h2>
<p>My neighbor, another ham, gave me a TV antenna rotator and homebrew controller.  The controller requires a five wire connection to the rotator, three for power and two to measure voltage across a potentiometer that indicates direction.  I had planned to incorporate controlling the rotator into the initial project until I started to investiate how to provide power to it.  The antenna rotator obviously requires more power to operate than I could deliver over PoE.  The homebrew controller provides 40V AC from a substanial transformer connected 110V AC.  The 40V AC appears to need to be reversed to rotate the controller in opposite directions, meaning four relays need to be used as a DPDT switch.  By the time I configure this, I still need to provide at least three wires up to the rotator, plus the ethernet to the Seeeduino.  I am not sure I'll complete this, instead I am planning to run 18 gauge, 7 conductor, sprinkler wire to the rotator.</p>
<h2>Antenna Tuner?</h2>
<p>Secondary to the antenna switch and rotator controller, I wanted to connect either my LDG Z100 autotuner or another autotuner to the Seeeduino.  Locating the tuner near the antenna switch would allow me to minimize the impedance mismatch over the majority of my feedline, about 50ft from my shack to the mast on my garage.  The controls for the LDG autotuner appear to be pretty minimal, using a four pin connector from my Icom radio, esentially power and ground, and two pins communicate when to tune and status of tuning.  This should be easy to add at a future point.</p>

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>One of those magical things that has kept me interested in ham radio all these years has been the idea of bouncing signals off of things, particularly those in space.  I've long wanted to give meteor scatter a try, so I want to get my station set up for that this winter.  It seems much more within reach than satellite operations (next on my list) or <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon%E2%80%93Earth_communication">EME communication</a>.  Satellite repeaters requiring specialized antennas or at least good timing and knowing where to point a handheld antenna, while EME requiring some amplifiers outside of my budget for this hobby.</p>
<p>It appears I can use a 2-element beam for 50MHz that my neighbor gave me, along with my IC-706MKIIG radio, and the WSJT-X software.  I want to mount the 50MHz antenna on a mast over my garage, and then get the software and radio set up to try some meteor scatter contacts in the morning before my kid gets up.</p>

<h2>Progress - February 2022</h2>
<p>I got my 6m antenna up this weekend on a tripod and 10 foot mast.  This is at the high end of the recommended height without guywires for the tripod, so I should make adding those my next step.  I've been unable to get a friend's NanoVNA to work to check the antenna's resonance.</p>
<p>I gave up on trying to automate the rotator, I might add something to the control box in the future, but for now, the antenna is facing roughly southeast, which I hope will give me some opportunity for early morning meteor scatter operations.</p>
