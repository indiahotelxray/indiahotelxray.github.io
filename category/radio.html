                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I've been trying to operate my HF radio station remotely for the last month, using Windows Remote Desktop and <a class="external" href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a> to sit and make some FT8 contacts while drinking my morning coffee.  This has worked well but I want to remove the step of having to remember to turn off my radio when I am done.  The power supply and radio are mounted in a closed cabinet.  Leaving the cabinet open invites exploration by our feline companion, while leaving it shut and powered up for long periods of time may result in the temperature rising more than I want.</p>
<p>I ordered a simple relay board and decided to put it inside of my power supply, to be triggered by a program on the computer to turn the station on and off.  West Mountain Radio sells <a class="external" href="https://www.westmountainradio.com/product_info.php?products_id=rr_4005i">a network connected control and monitor system</a> with Power Pole connectors that would be great for this, but it's also $280 which is a lot more than I want to spend for this little effort.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>Last weekend after getting all the parts, I took a few moments out in my shop to drill out some holes and mount the relay board, and wire the relay into the circuit of the power supply.  I had selected a relay that is adequate for the AC side of the power supply, which are more commonly available on a premade board than those capable of handling 12V/25A.  I made a few mistakes wiring it up, first mistakenly wiring it in series with the light inside the switch, and then wiring it to be normally closed when the relay is not powered.  </p>

<img alt="relay close up" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_relay_closeupa.jpg">.</p>
<p>The final mistake I made was wiring up connector that I put on the back of my power supply.  I had decided to use a 1/8" TRS connector to provide power, ground, and signal to the relay from the control board, but instead of soldering to the tip and ring pins, I soldered to pins used to indicate when the plug is removed!  I connected ground to the shield, power to the ring, and signal to the tip, figuring this would ensure the least bad results if any of the pins made contact while inserting the plug.</p>
<p><img alt="bad plug wiring" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_plug_to_fixa.jpg"></p>
<p>After fixing the misconnected pins on the TRS socket, I needed to wire this up to my computer somehow.  My temporary solution is to use an old Arduino (which has been flaky to program) to provide +5V and ground to power the relay whenever my computer is connected to it.  Longer term, I am planning to develop a shack control board and software that can use an Arduino or similar board to monitor and control several aspects of my shack.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Design</h2>
<p>I wanted a remote antenna switch, and commercial models seem to be expensive relative to what I am willing to spend.  I planned to combine an Arduino, ethernet shield with power over ethernet, and a board with four relays.  This assumes that commonly available relay boards would work fine for switching HF signals, providing both adequate isolation (separation when an antenna is turned off) and have minimal losses when in use.  I had planned to add on remote control for an automatic antenna tuner and an antenna rotator, but those two features will be for some future iteration of the project.  I have at least two HF antennas I wanted to connect, a short G5RV and a two element 6M beam.</p>
<h3>Micrcontroller</h3>
<p>After running into issues with a standard Arduino Uno and ethernet shield - there wasn't enough memory to serve up a minimal HTML page via HTTP to control the switch.  I looked at some successful projects using networked Arduinos for remote control, like the <a class="external" href="https://opensprinkler.com/">OpenSprinkler</a>, finding the source code was more optimized than I thought I could get for a one-off hobby project.</p>
<p>Next idea was to look at something like the Arduino Yún, which I discovered was unavailable at tthe time.  I did find Adafruit selling a clone called the <a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3034">Seeeduino Cloud</a>, marked as compatible with the Yún, and bought a <a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3785">Power over Ethernet (POE)</a>.  I would not recommend the Seeeduino Cloud as it uses a custom branch of the OpenWRT Linux distribution that several years since having any kind of update, and minimal documentation.  So I set up two parts - a static HTML page with JavaScript for interactivity, served up by the Seeeduino's Linux side, and used the Arduino YunBridge library with a REST API to turn the appropriate pins for each relay on and off.  It works <em>okay</em>, but can be a bit buggy when the Arduino loses it's connection.</p>
<h3>Relay board</h3>
<p>I mounted a <a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/4-channel-5v-relay-module">Sainsmart relay board</a> and Seeeduino into an old project box I had bought years ago for a manual antenna switch and never implemented.  I built a small RF sheild around the relay board using an old piece of aluminum bent to fit around it, and wired it up using some speaker wire and panel mount <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_connector">SO239 connectors</a></p>
<p>I had considered their relay board with a <a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/rj45-tcp-ip-remote-control-board-with-integrated-8-ch-relay">built-in web server</a>, but this was out of stock at the time.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I can't tell if there is <em>any</em> isolation between these.  I used a friend's NanoVNA to find minimal losses on each of the connectors when selected, but I cannot hear any difference between connectors on the radio with one antenna hooked up.</p>
<p>My next steps will be to rewire the relay board to directly solder to the PCB with short stubs of 14 gage copper wire to each connector and see if this works better.</p>
<h2>Antenna Rotator?</h2>
<p>My neighbor, another ham, gave me a TV antenna rotator and homebrew controller.  The controller requires a five wire connection to the rotator, three for power and two to measure voltage across a potentiometer that indicates direction.  I had planned to incorporate controlling the rotator into the initial project until I started to investiate how to provide power to it.  The antenna rotator obviously requires more power to operate than I could deliver over PoE.  The homebrew controller provides 40V AC from a substanial transformer connected 110V AC.  The 40V AC appears to need to be reversed to rotate the controller in opposite directions, meaning four relays need to be used as a DPDT switch.  By the time I configure this, I still need to provide at least three wires up to the rotator, plus the ethernet to the Seeeduino.  I am not sure I'll complete this, instead I am planning to run 18 gauge, 7 conductor, sprinkler wire to the rotator.</p>
<h2>Antenna Tuner?</h2>
<p>Secondary to the antenna switch and rotator controller, I wanted to connect either my LDG Z100 autotuner or another autotuner to the Seeeduino.  Locating the tuner near the antenna switch would allow me to minimize the impedance mismatch over the majority of my feedline, about 50ft from my shack to the mast on my garage.  The controls for the LDG autotuner appear to be pretty minimal, using a four pin connector from my Icom radio, esentially power and ground, and two pins communicate when to tune and status of tuning.  This should be easy to add at a future point.</p>

                <h2>Plans</h2>
<p>One of those magical things that has kept me interested in ham radio all these years has been the idea of bouncing signals off of things, particularly those in space.  I've long wanted to give meteor scatter a try, so I want to get my station set up for that this winter.  It seems much more within reach than satellite operations (next on my list) or <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon%E2%80%93Earth_communication">EME communication</a>.  Satellite repeaters requiring specialized antennas or at least good timing and knowing where to point a handheld antenna, while EME requiring some amplifiers outside of my budget for this hobby.</p>
<p>It appears I can use a 2-element beam for 50MHz that my neighbor gave me, along with my IC-706MKIIG radio, and the WSJT-X software.  I want to mount the 50MHz antenna on a mast over my garage, and then get the software and radio set up to try some meteor scatter contacts in the morning before my kid gets up.</p>
