                <p>Before I started woodworking, I always thought handplanes were a quirky part of the woodworking hobby, something that people collected but not commonly used.  I bought one #4 plane from Harbor Freight during my cutting board project to help square up the strips.  I figured it was a lot cheaper than buying a planer or other pieces of power equipment.  In trying to make it actually work, I found out these are still serious tools, and lots of craftsman do really amazing woodworking by hand.  While there are a number of YouTube channels dedicated to hand tool woodworking, the one I most recommend is <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RexKrueger/">Rex Kruger (YouTube)</a>.  He has a bunch of great videos about restoring and using old and cheap tools, and does a great job explaining the how and why of these tools and techniques.</p>

<h2>An inventory of my hand planes</h2>
<p>From left to right in the photo above.</p>
<h3>Harbor Freight block plane</h3>
<p>Pretty much useless, occasionally use to knock off some sharp edges.  Came with the #4 plane as a box set.</p>
<h3>Dunlop block plane</h3>
<p>Likely belonged to my grandfather, I found this still in the box in my dad's garage.  I use this one regularly for trimming up the ends of boards.</p>
<h3>Craftsman block plane</h3>
<p>Very similar model, bought at an antique store near my parent's house before I knew about the one my dad had.</p>
<h3>Harbor Freight No. 4 "Scrub" Plane</h3>
<p>This was the first plane I bought and found impossible to use out of the box.  (a plane, from harbor freight, that wasn't ready to go?  you don't say...)  I later gave the blade a heavy camber to use it as a scrub plane which it does really well at due to the wide throat.</p>
<h3>Dunlop No. 4 Smoothing Plane</h3>
<p>Likely belonged to my grandfather, kept in the original box for years.  I love using this plane, it works really well for finishing a project.  My dad pointed me to these after buying the Stanley #5 and Craftsman Block Plane.</p>
<h3>Stanley No. 5 Jack Plane</h3>
<p>Bought at an antique store near my parents house.  This is really my "jack" of all trades plane, using it for everything from stock prep to planing edges for joints.</p>
