                <p>My woodshop is the back half of my garage, which was added as an addition by some previous owner.  There is an obvious gap between the front and back halfs, where a hole was framed up and cut open  I've long wanted to make my shop more usable in the winter by dividing it off from the garage.  Every winter I use a few electric heaters to warm it up each day that I want to use it.  While I would like to insulate the walls someday, I'm starting with cutting the space to heat in half as a quick way to make the space heaters more effective.  </p>
<p>This weekend I framed out a wall, hung a couple of interior doors that were in the garage rafters when I moved in, and used a sheet of fiberboard cover one side.</p>
<p>My next steps are to close off the right hand side with a plexiglass window to allow a little light and visibilty between halves of the garage.  Then I want to put up some trim to make the doors look a bit more professional and seal off the edges.  And they all need a good cleaning from the dust that has accumulated on them over the years.</p>

<p>Previous shop improvements I made include upgrading the electrical (I contracted this out), added some air filtration equipment, and a couple of additional places to store tools and supplies.</p>
