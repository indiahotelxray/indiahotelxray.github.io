                <p>The other day, we decided to cancel our paid Spotify account that we had started near the begining of the pandemic, and start using our old digital and vinyl music libraries more.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, I wanted to get our digital music library on a local streaming server that we could listen to from our phones without needing to download all 80 gigabytes.  I had tried this once before, and for several reasons abandoned the effort.</p>
<h3>Reason #1: Client Software</h3>
<p>When I last tried this when my spouse and I were both using iPhones several years ago and found all of the streaming apps unsatisfactory.  Either the streaming apps were coupled with a specific server (makes sense) or used DNLA, which sounds great in concept but I discovered is a complete disaster of a protocol.</p>
<h3>Reason #2: Server Software</h3>
<p>The better server software was framed as open source but with some kind of a premium subscription to enable all the features, and this better software often had features meant to include streaming video as well, not something that I needed.</p>
<h3>Reason #3: Organizing a mess of digital music files.</h3>
<p>My spouse and I both have a mess of music files from before we met, and I had integrated a number of her music files into my library over the years, but not everything.</p>
<p>On top of that, Apple Music had their fiasco where they started scanning people's libraries and replacing files with official copies, eliminting rarities, b-sides, covers, and live bootlegs in the process, as well as moving unplayed files to the cloud if your hard drive storage was getting small.  I was able to fix some of this by moving my music library onto my PC and recovering what I could, but it left me with a few version of my library, including files in different encodings and bit-rates.</p>
<p>At the time, I tried using the <a class="external" href="https://beets.readthedocs.io">beets</a> music organizer.</p>
<h2>How I did it this time</h2>
<p>First, I moved the messy, unmerged, but deduped versions of our music libraries onto a disk.</p>
<p>Selecting Airsonic against others?</p>
<p>Setup Airsonic, then Airsonic Advanced</p>
<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>
