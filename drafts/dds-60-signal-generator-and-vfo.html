                </h2>

                
                

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I bought a DDS-60 VFO board from <a class="external" href="https://midnightdesignsolutions.com/dds60/">Midnight Design Solutions</a> almost a decade ago, with the intent of using it to build a HF antenna analyzer.  I built an Arduino shield to hold it, but never got around to the RF power meters required to use it as an antenna analyzer.  </p>
<p>In the summer of 2020, during wildfire season and sociall distancing due to COVID, I was assembling a <a class="external" href="https://qrpkits.com/tribander.html">KD1JV Tri-Bander CW tranceiver kit</a> that a neighbor had bought and not finished.  I am not sure that the upper and lower band filters were working correctly, as the radio was totally deaf and putting out zero power.  I briefly got out the Arduino DDS-60 sheild that I had built to help diagnose the issue, and <a class="external" href="https://github.com/indiahotelxray/dds60-siggen">wrote a control program</a> to switch between bands.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>The front panel has room for two buttons, a rotary encoder with a push button built in, and the display.  The two buttons and push button on the rotary encoder.  On the rear panel, the Arduino's USB port and power supply are available, along with three of the analog pins broken out with RCA connectors for future use.</p>
<p>I designed four modes for the device, selectable by using one of the push buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal Generator: Produces a output at a single frequency.</li>
<li>Sweep: Sweeps across a range of frequencies automatically.</li>
<li>VFO: same as signal generator mode, but limited to ham bands, with a button to jump between bands.</li>
<li>Memory: recalls specific frequencies from the EEPROM.  These can be saved via a serial protocol (untested).</li>
</ul>
<p>The rotary encoder changes the frequency, or the start for the sweep mode.  Pressing the button on the rotary encoder changes the step size when the encoder is turned.</p>
<p>The second push button can provide an additional function for each mode.  In VFO mode, it switches bands, while in signal generator mode, it increments the frequency by 1 MHz.</p>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago, my ham neighbor who gave me the tranceiver kit was also clearing out his shack and gave me a number of items, including an old serial port switch that was just the right size to turn into a case.  I manually laid out the panels and drilled out the holes, trying to reuse existing holes where possible.  The holes are pretty sloppy, as I am not much of a machinist.  they'll work for this.  I  spray-painted the panels a black paint that I had sitting around, unfortunately, it beads up to create a hammered metal look, and that resulted in a very splotchy panel.</p>

<h2>Software changes to make.</h2>
<p>I need to test this software with the display I am using.  I had managed to burn out the Adafruit SSD1306 I2C OLED display I was using, so to complete the project, I switched to a standard HD44780-style display.  This will require quite a few more pins to control, and need to switch out the library used.  On the other hand, this might save some memory space, as the Adafruit.</p>
