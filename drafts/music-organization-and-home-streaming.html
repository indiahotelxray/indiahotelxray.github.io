                <p>The other day, we decided to cancel our paid Spotify account that we had started near the begining of the pandemic, and start using our old digital and vinyl music libraries more.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, I wanted to get our digital music library on a local streaming server that we could listen to from our phones without needing to download all 80 gigabytes.  I had tried this once before, and for several reasons abandoned the effort.</p>
<h3>Reason #1: Client Software</h3>
<p>When I last tried this when my spouse and I were both using iPhones several years ago and found all of the streaming apps unsatisfactory.  Either the streaming apps were coupled with a specific server (makes sense) or used DNLA, which sounds great in concept but I discovered is a complete disaster of a protocol.</p>
<h3>Reason #2: Server Software</h3>
<p>The better server software was framed as open source but with some kind of a premium subscription to enable all the features, and this better software often had features meant to include streaming video as well, not something that I needed.</p>
<h3>Reason #3: Organizing a mess of digital music files.</h3>
<p>My spouse and I both have a mess of music files from before we met, and I had integrated a number of her music files into my library over the years, but not everything.</p>
<p>On top of that, Apple Music had their fiasco where they started scanning people's libraries and replacing files with official copies, eliminting rarities, b-sides, covers, and live bootlegs in the process, as well as moving unplayed files to the cloud if your hard drive storage was getting small.  I was able to fix some of this by moving my music library onto my PC and recovering what I could, but it left me with a few version of my library, including files in different encodings and bit-rates.</p>
<p>At the time, I tried using the <a class="external" href="https://beets.readthedocs.io">beets</a> music organizer.</p>
<h2>How I did it this time</h2>
<p>First, I moved the messy, unmerged, but deduped versions of our music libraries onto a disk on the server I was working on.</p>
<p>Second, I moved any music that I felt fairly confident could be imported with minimal effort and really wanted access to.</p>
<p>Third, I separated the music I wanted but was unsure of the correctness of and cleaned these up with <code>beets</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, I spent quite a few weeks cleaning up the remaining music with <code>beets</code>.</p>
<h3>Music Server</h3>
<p>For my music server, I tried Airsonic and then updated to Airsonic Advance when putting it on the server machine.  The Airsonic Advanced server is a fork of a fork of the original Subsonic source code before it became a closed source, "freemium" plan product.</p>
<p>Airsonic Advanced was chosen based on it running on Java and minimal external dependencies.  Many similar servers are available, but most require additional dependencies.</p>
<h4>Issues: Album Artwork</h4>
<p>I am not sure if the server or client is causing this problem, but the album art displayed when music is plaiyng is always the first album I tried on my phone, Codes and Keys by Death Cab for Cutie in my case.  It appears across multiple clients that I tried, and it's always that first album.  It must be the server, since it's always the same, regardless of client used and occured on multiple phones.</p>
<h3>Client Program</h3>
<p>I looked at a few of the clients listed on the Airsonic documentation and settled on DSub, which works well enough for local play, but ability to download and take music on the go is not that great.  I also tested...</p>
<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>
