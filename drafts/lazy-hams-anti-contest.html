                <h2>The Lazy Ham</h2>
<p>This anti-contest is meant for the busy or lazy ham who dedicates more thought than actual activity to the hobby, including working parents, homeowners with fixeruppers or long honeydew lists, or those on a budget.  It is meant to encourage participating in the hobby but particularly rewards being a 'bad' ham.  (Note, this does not mean a poorly-behaved and inconsiderate ham.)  There are 'penalties' for consistent operation, chasing points and awards, and contesting, or at least being successful at those things.</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>For years I have thought about organizing a "ragchewing" contest, and for years I have made various New Years resolutions to get more involved in the hobby; this is the result.  It is inspired by things like <a class="external" href="https://www.pokernews.com/poker-rules/omaha-hi-lo.htm">"Omaha Hi-Lo" poker</a>, the complexity of ARRL Field Day Rules, and the <a class="internal" href="jamespropp.org/srat-Q.txt">SRAT</a>.</p>
<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>One eleventh of the <a class="external" href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression">current projected solar cycle</a>, starting at 0000 hours UTC on the day this post goes live.</p>
<h3>QSO Points</h3>
<p>1 point - any QSO
1 point - DX heard but not worked
2 points - any QSO on a VHF band
2 points - any following QSO with a previous contact
5 points - QSO with a special events station
5 points - eyeball QSO with another ham outside of those in your household or work unit
10 points - QSO with a ham you have previously had an eyeball QSO with (counted once per eyeball QSO)</p>
<p>Twice per day, 2 QSO points can be earned for an unanswered CQ or repeater call.</p>
<h3>Exchange</h3>
<h3>Modifiers</h3>
<h4>Ragchewing Bonus</h4>
<p>(image of a dirty rag)
Each minute a QSO lasts over five minutes is worth an additional two points.  QSOs where one or more participating members has to step away for an errand or other business in the middle of the QSO may include this time, up to 15 minutes.</p>
<h4>Antenna Height</h4>
<p>Subtract a point for every foot over 30 ft as measured to the ground from your antenna's feedpoint.</p>
<h4>Accessories</h4>
<p>Subtract a point for every accessory (item not included with stock radio) attached to your radio.  This does not include any cables, transmission lines, antennas, or one (1) power supply.  This does not your antenna unless you are using a handheld, in which case an aftermarket antenna does count for a deduction.  This includes a soundcard interface, or other interface to a computer, but not the computer.</p>
<h4>IOTA / SOTA / POTA activations</h4>
<p>Islands on the Air, Summits on the Air, and Parks on the Air are encouraged.  Any successful activation is worth negative point as assigned by the rules under that program.  A planned activation is worth positive points if considered for more than five minutes and initial planning or research takes place.</p>
<p>Chasing is also encourage, but worth the same as QSO would be awarded under that program, unless a certificate is issued, in which case the cerficate rules below apply.</p>
<h3>QSO Multi-pliers</h3>
<p>(image of plyers)</p>
<h4>QTH</h4>
<p>5x points for QSOs operated within the same county as your primary residence.
2x points for QSOs within the same state or provence as your primary residence.
1.5 points for QSOs within the same DXCC enttity as your primary residence.</p>
<p>First QSOs with a new DXCC entity not previously worked are not worth any points.</p>
<h4>Power - QRP</h4>
<p>Divide the QSO's points by the orders of magnitude below 10W.</p>
<h4>Power - QRO</h4>
<p>Divide the QSO's points by increments of 100W greater than your radio's stock output. For example, a contact made with an amplifier at 1500W on radio capable of 200W would be divided by 13.</p>
<h3>Regular operating penalties:</h3>
<p>Any consectutive 7-day or longer period in which any QSO points are earned every day is negated and and worth zero points.</p>
<p>Any four consecutive weekends in which points are earned are worth half the points previously calculated.</p>
<h3>Irregular operating bonus:</h3>
<p>Irregular operating bonsu: Any whole lunar month (from new moon to next new moon) in which points would otherwise not be accumulated during the contest is worth the same as the prior lunar cycle in which points were earned.  This cannot be used more than one month in a row.</p>
<h3>Contests and paper chasing</h3>
<p>If the only contest participated in is ARRL Field Day or your state QSO party, count it for positive points.</p>
<p>Subtract the score of any other contest you participate in, individually or as a club, during the anti-contest.</p>
<p>Subtract the score of any certificates awarded for activities during the anti-contest.  If no score is associated, subtract the number of entities required or 100 points, whichever is less.  For example, Worked All States is -50 points.</p>
<h3>Bonus Points</h3>
<p>Add 1 point for each half-hour block spent working on radio projects but not operating (also known as 'futzing around in the garage')</p>
<p>Add 1 point for each QSL card received.  Add 2 points for each QSL card sent.</p>
<p>Add 1 point for every day since your personal / ham radio webpage was last updated.</p>
<p>Subtract 1 point for each word in your QRZ.com bio.  Subtract 10 points for each image or graphic.</p>
<p>Add 2 points for each time you try to explain a radio project to your spouse, a friend, or a coworker at their request.  Subtract 10 points if they are annoyed after trying to explain said project.</p>
<p>Add 5 points for each valid QSL card filled out but not mailed.</p>
<p>Add 5 points for each QST in your house at the end of the contest, received and left unread during this contest.  This only applies to paper editions.  Reading digital copies of QST does not count.  This rule will be revoked if the ARRL offers a paperless subscription to regular members.</p>
<p>Add 5 points for each radio brought on a vacation but not used (can be counted for multiple vacations)</p>
<p>Add 10 points for each radio or amplifier acquired during this contest, but not used to make a QSO.</p>
<p>Add 10 points each time the "F&amp;@# it, it's called amateur radio for a reason" principle is applied to a project.</p>
<p>Add 10 points for each antenna you have 'in storage', functional or otherwise.</p>
<p>Add 20 points for each homebrew project, including antennas, started but not successfuly completed during the contest period.</p>
<p>Add 20 points for each act of kindness towards, or otherwise assisting, another ham that does not yield points for yourself.</p>
<p>Add 50 points for being a lasped ARRL member.</p>
<p>Add 50 points for each club you are loosely affiliated with or attend fewer than three meetings per year.</p>
<p>Add 50 points for each vehicle in your household with ham plates, but no permenantly installed radio or antenna for the duration of the contest.</p>
<p>Add 100 points for not having a permantently installed antenna at your residence.</p>
<p>Add 200 points for not having a dedicated radio room in your residence.</p>
<p>Add points equal to the value in US dollars of ham gear sold during the period, up to 500 points.</p>
<p>Add points equal to three times the fair market value, in US dollars, of ham gear given away during the period, up to 1500 points.</p>
<p>Subtract 100 points for attending four or more ham club meetings during the anti-contest</p>
<p>Subtract 500 points for each leadership position in a club held during the anti-contest.</p>
<h3>Submitting score and logs</h3>
<p>Subtract 100 points if you kept a log.  Subtract 200 points if you kept a log just for this anti-contest.</p>
<p>Calculating your score on paper or in a spreadsheet is allowed and encouraged.  A random bonus will be assigned to the most creative method of tracking points.</p>
<p>Please submit your score to [...].  Scores may be submitted at any time during or after the anti-contest.  Positive scores will be considered on the honor system.  Negative scores require complete documentation.</p>
<p>Winners will be notified and contest scores will be posted whenever I get <a class="external" href="https://www.etsy.com/market/round_tuit_coin">around to it</a>.</p>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>A token prize will be awarded to the hams who submit the highest (most positive) and lowest (most negative) score.  e-Certificates will be awarded to any ham who submits a score.  Honorable mentions will be awarded to the best stories, tall tales, or excuses submitted with a score.</p>
<h3>Disqualificiation</h3>
<p>Actively attempting to maxmize or minimize your score is discouraged, but not a disqualifier.  Targetting an arbitrary number is encouraged.</p>
<p>Performing or failing to perform n activity with the sole intent of earning points is frowned upon.  Too much of it will result in disqualification at the operator's judgement.</p>
<p>Any ham who modifies or develops a logging software to track or calculate their score in this contest is automatically disqualified.</p>
<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
<p>The number one rule of this is that it is all in good fun.  I appologize if anyone has proposed this previously, and for any offense taken.  It is meant to poke light hearted fun at the dedication of 'real serious' hams.  Those who still take offense are disqualified.  Interpretation of the rules above and resolution of abiguiities is up to the anti-contest anti-judges.</p>
