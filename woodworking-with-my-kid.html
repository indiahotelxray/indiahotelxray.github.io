                <p>I built a toolbox for my kid, based on plans in Rex Kruger's Everyday Woodworking, and filled with tools based on McKee's Woodworking With Kids, a project book full of ideas about how to do woodworking with kids starting at age 4.  McKee's Woodworking with Kids was available at my local library, but I bought a copy as it has a few dozen project ideas as well as some good recommendations about how to make tools safe for kids.</p>
<p>Building the toolbox was pretty quick.  I did build it using my tablesaw and other powertools, so making all the parts took a small part of a weekend morning.  I had my kid help assemble it, using the hammer and nails I purchased to put in it.  I might need to add some glue, as the nails don't seem to hold every joint as well as I had hoped.</p>
<p>I purchased handtools for him, based on the recommendations in Woodworking with Kids, all from a regional big box store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety glasses</li>
<li>Coping saw</li>
<li>Tape measure</li>
<li>"6-in-1" screwdriver</li>
<li>Small 10oz Hammer (replaced a 7oz hammer I had in my toolbox I keep in a kitchen cabinet) and small wire nails</li>
<li>Speed square</li>
<li>Surform plane for smoothing and shaping</li>
</ul>
<p>So far my kid has been really enjoying cutting out shapes with the coping saw (or at least telling me what to do) and then nailing them together (or at least telling me how to put them together).  He seems to be developing some of the skills to properly saw a board, although he gets tired quickly.  It's been a good outdoor activity as the weather gets nicer.  He knows which tool parts are sharp and is careful with them, and he's been learning to measure out and mark his cuts.  He has clearly developed a sense of what he wants to do in each session, although putting it all together takes some help from me.</p>
<p>Since we've been using the bench of our picnic table, I need to finish building the other project from Rex Kruger's Everday Woodworking to keep it from getting damaged.  I had built the bench top on my own, and then my kid helped me bore out the mortise holes.  I think that carving down the tenons on the legs is a task I need to complete on my own, followed by final assembly.</p>
