                <p>I wanted to come up with a good activity to do with my kid that we could enjoy together.  A couple of months ago, I found <a class="external" href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/woodshop-for-kids_jack-mckee/441739/">Jack McKee's Woodshop for Kids</a> at my local library and after renewing the maximum number of times, ended up buying a copy.  It has a few dozen project ideas as well as some good recommendations about how to make tools safe for kids, starting as early as age 4.  Well, my kid's birthday is right around the corner!</p>
<p>I built a toolbox for my kid, based on plans in <a class="external" href="https://www.rexkrueger.com/everyday-woodworkingautographed-editions">Rex Krueger's Everyday Woodworking</a>.  Building the toolbox was pretty quick asended up using my tablesaw to make the parts.  I had my kid help assemble it, using the hammer and nails I purchased to put in it.  He did about 10% of the hammering and left me to do the rest.  I might need to add some glue, as the nails don't seem to hold every joint as well as I had hoped.</p>
<p>I purchased some handtools to fill the box, based on the recommendations in McKee's Woodshop for Kids, and that I felt were safe enough that he wouldn't send himself to the hospital:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety glasses (I added an adjustable strap to help hold these on his face)</li>
<li>Coping saw</li>
<li>Tape measure</li>
<li>"6-in-1" screwdriver</li>
<li>Small 10oz Hammer (replaced a 7oz hammer I had in my toolbox I keep in a kitchen cabinet) and small wire nails</li>
<li>Speed square</li>
<li>Surform plane for smoothing and shaping</li>
</ul>
<p>So far my kid has been really enjoying cutting out shapes with the coping saw (or at least telling me what to do when he gets tired) and then nailing them together (or at least telling me how to put them together).  He seems to be developing some of the skills to saw a board, although he gets tired of doing it quickly.  It's been a good outdoor activity as the weather gets nicer.  He knows which tool parts are sharp and is careful with them, and he's been learning to measure out and mark his cuts.  He has clearly developed a sense of what he wants to do in each session, although putting it all together takes some help from me.</p>
<p>Since we've been using the bench of our picnic table, I need to finish building the other project from Rex Krueger's Everday Woodworking to keep it from getting damaged.  I had built the bench top on my own, and then my kid helped me bore out the mortise holes.  I think that carving down the tenons on the legs is a task I need to complete on my own, but then we'll have a better surface for both of us to work at.</p>
