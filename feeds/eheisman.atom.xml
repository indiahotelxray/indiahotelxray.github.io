&lt;p&gt;My house came with a beautiful old apple tree in the yard, probably dating to around the time the house was built (1950), which is incredibly prolific, meaning we get more apples than we can ever turn into baked goods and apple sauce in one year.  Several times I have tried making some kind of apple cider with the fruit from the tree, using various methods to avoid renting a press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a winemaking region, I have a number of friends with expertise, but most fruit presses available to me are for 20 or more gallons of fruit at a time.  It feels silly to pay to rent one of these, so I wanted to make something a little better scaled for my personal needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my account of building a (not-so) quick and dirty cider press.  My goal isn't to build the most elegant fruit press ever, just something functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvising a press screw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure this is one of the more critical pieces, and where I was willing to spend the most money, but also wanted to avoid spending as much as a commercial press would cost to buy.  I started building the frame for a press years ago, with the idea to use a scissor jack to provide compression, but discovered that the one in my car wouldn't extend when a five gallon bucket was placed under it.  For several years I had considered buying a cheap bench screw online, but most of the ones for sale were too short, 18 inches long or less, which doesn't provide enough depth for this.  This weekend I finally broke down and ordered a few critical parts: a 24" 5/8-inch 11-tpi threaded rod made from stainless steel and accompanying nuts and washers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cider press in progress" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_in_progress_20211231a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting press mechanism appears to work really well, or at least more smoothly than I was expecting.  One key thing I did was making sure the nut was well aligned with the hole that the threaded rod would go through.  I squeezed the nut that sits in the thrust block by first placing the rod in the nut, and then putting this through the thrust block on top of the pre-drilled frame.  This gave me a good ~8 inches or so of hole that helped align the whole mechanism as I used a mallet to force the nut into the slightly undersized hole I had drilled and chiseled out for it.  Note, don't use too much force here, the first thrust block was made of some cheap construction lumber and split during this step.  I made the second one with a piece of heavy elm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="thrust block as cut" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\cider_press_thrust_block_20211220a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mounted the thrust block with six countersunk screws, pre-drilling each hole to avoid having this piece crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the bucket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a five gallon bucket and attached some wooden staves and metal banding to strengthen it.  The staves were made from 1/3 width pieces of 2x4 and spaced evenly around the bucket.  The staves were attached to one piece of metal banding while laid out on my workbench, using a strip of wood as a guide to provide even spacing.  I then rolled around the bucket before straightening and attaching the second band.  These were then pressure fit over the bucket by gently tapping on a mallet until they were snug - I had sized the bands to give about an inch between the rim of the bucket and the top of the staves, giving me some space to tighten it this way but should still be removable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="staves on workbench" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\staves_20211231a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drilled holes about every inch around the bottom to let juice out - pretty much one under each stave and between each stave.  After testing on another HDPE bucket, I settled on using a brad point bit and taking it really slow.  That still produced a few rough edges, so I came back with a countersink bit to help clean those up.  The final holes aren't amazing, but clean enough for this use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding feet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="legs attached upside down" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\leg_whoopsie_20221116a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut out the notch in them using the table saw and chisel.  The ends were done on the miter saw.  After getting it wrong the first time (see above), I took these off, recut the ends, and attached with glue and screws through the bottom.  The bottom of the frame is not very level as you can see in the photo, so I am hoping that these add much needed stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carving the handle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had tested the press screw with a piece of 2x4 that I carved a spot for a nut into, but I wanted the handle to be a little more ergonomic than that.  I started the handle by freehanding some curves (well, tracing part of the bottom of the 5-gallon bucket) into each end, and took a 1-1/2" chisel to pare down to the line.  I had to cut a few relief cuts to help, trying various saws.  I found the wide-kerf rough-cutting one that came with my cheap miter box was the fastest at this, but I also overshot a few times.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press handle in progress showing relief cuts" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_handle_in_progress_20220117a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clean it all up, I took a belt sander clamped to my workbench and worked over all the surfaces I had carved with 100 grit sand paper before applying paste wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press_handle" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_finished_handle_20220117a.jpg"&gt;
Finished press handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pressure plate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attaching the pressure plate to the end of the screw was something I thought about for a while, and after I test this I am open to redoing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press plate being planed" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_pressure_plate_planeda.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laminated a few pieces of hard mape that were in my scrap pile together to create a piece of wood that I think will withstand the pressure that I will need to apply to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press plate yoke" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_pressure_plate_yokea.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned to drill a hole for the screw to sit in, and place the plate under the screw with the hole using pressure to hold it in place.  This would make it a little messy and difficult to retract after each presssing, so I decided to make a yoke to hold the end of the screw.  This also let me add about an additional inch of depth or more if I count not needing to go in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press plate on screw" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_pressure_plate_on_screwa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yoke was made from a piece of pine 2x4 using a forstner bit to drill out the hole for the nuts to freely rotate in. I made sure there was enough space to get a wrench in to tighten the nuts.  I might add a metal plate to contact area below the screw if I find that it is damaging the wood.  I am also a little worried that if the plate gets stuck the yoke won't be strong enough to pull up on and will break near the top where the screw goes through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pre-drilled two counter sunk holes on each end of the yoke and screw it onto the pressure plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="press plate test fit" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_pressure_plate_in_placea.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I test fit the whole assembly, it looks like the plate is just small enough to travel to the bottom of the bucket.  If the two sides with wider gaps are too big, I'll have to make a new one, but it should be easy to replace if I want to keep the yoke or plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plate will need to have some kind of finish applied to it.  I will probably use the mineral oil and beeswax mixture that I apply to my cutting boards, as it is food safe and won't go rancid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go under the bucket, I drilled a large hole in one end of a rimmed cookie sheet.  I think this will work well to collect the juice and drain it into a bucket or funnel.  I won't attach this piece to the frame so that it is easy to take off for cleaning or to replace if it doesn't work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the press finished, I need to aactually press some fruit.  I have five gallons of apples fermenting in a mini-fridge at the moment, which will be a good first test.  Following that, I know several friends with other fruits that I've discussed fruit wine making with before.  I'll let you all know how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wood"></category></entry><entry><title>DDS-60 Signal Generator and VFO</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/dds-60-signal-generator-and-vfo.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-06T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2022-02-06:/dds-60-signal-generator-and-vfo.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a DDS-60 VFO board from &lt;a class="external" href="https://midnightdesignsolutions.com/dds60/"&gt;Midnight Design Solutions&lt;/a&gt; almost a decade ago, with the intent of using it to build a HF antenna analyzer.

&lt;p&gt;I bought a DDS-60 VFO board from &lt;a class="external" href="https://midnightdesignsolutions.com/dds60/"&gt;Midnight Design Solutions&lt;/a&gt; almost a decade ago, with the intent of using it to build a HF antenna analyzer.  I built an Arduino shield to hold it, but never got around to the RF power meters required to use it as an antenna analyzer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2020, during wildfire season and sociall distancing due to COVID, I was assembling a &lt;a class="external" href="https://qrpkits.com/tribander.html"&gt;KD1JV Tri-Bander CW tranceiver kit&lt;/a&gt; that a neighbor had bought and not finished.  I am not sure that the upper and lower band filters were working correctly, as the radio was totally deaf and putting out zero power.  I briefly got out the Arduino DDS-60 sheild that I had built to help diagnose the issue, and &lt;a class="external" href="https://github.com/indiahotelxray/dds60-siggen"&gt;wrote a control program&lt;/a&gt; to switch between bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front panel has room for two buttons, a rotary encoder with a push button built in, and the display.  The two buttons and push button on the rotary encoder.  On the rear panel, the Arduino's USB port and power supply are available, along with three of the analog pins broken out with RCA connectors for future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed four modes for the device, selectable by using one of the push buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signal Generator: Produces a output at a single frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweep: Sweeps across a range of frequencies automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VFO: same as signal generator mode, but limited to ham bands, with a button to jump between bands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: recalls specific frequencies from the EEPROM.  These can be saved via a serial protocol (untested).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotary encoder changes the frequency, or the start for the sweep mode.  Pressing the button on the rotary encoder changes the step size when the encoder is turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second push button can provide an additional function for each mode.  In VFO mode, it switches bands, while in signal generator mode, it increments the frequency by 1 MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, my ham neighbor who gave me the tranceiver kit was also clearing out his shack and gave me a number of items, including an old serial port switch that was just the right size to turn into a case.   This box came with front and back panels that could be removed entirely from the case, making them particularly easy to work with, and I initially had planned to just flip them around to hide the text.  I manually laid out the panels by tracing the panels on a sheet of paper and then trying to trace the components in their locations, trying to reuse or expand existing holes where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holes I drilled are sloppy, as I am not much of a machinist, but they'll work for this.  Particularly cutting out the square hole for the screen was difficult, using a dremel tool cut-off blade to quite a while.  After drilling, I took a light grinding bit and buffing bit to clean up any sharp edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  spray-painted the panels a black paint that I had sitting around, unfortunately, it beads up to create a hammered metal look, and that resulted in a splotchy looking finish.  Maybe not the best look for this panel, but it's the paint I had on hand and was better than the scratched up white paint from my amateur machining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="vfo case inside after painting" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\vfo_case_insidea.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before adding leads to the components, I test fit it all in the case.  At this point, I managed to mess up the finish a tiny bit by needing to drill an additional hole for the pin that keeps the rotary encoder in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="vfo case layout test" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\vfo_case_layouta.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="vfo case test assembled" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\vfo_case_assembeled_offa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to finish wiring up the display, buttons, and rotary encoder.  It appears that Arduino has built in pull-up resistors, so wiring the buttons should be a matter of connecting to a digital pin and ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software changes to make.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arduino sketch I am using resides on my &lt;a class="external" href="https://github.com/indiahotelxray/dds60-siggen"&gt;github account here&lt;/a&gt;.  I've started fixing some things now that I plan to actually put it into a case, not just use it as a breadboard and mess of wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rotary encoder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to try using one of the Arduino rotary encoder libraries.  I had not tested with the rotary encoder yet, just a pair of pushbuttons and assumed the rotary encoder would behave the same.  This appears to not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Display library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to test this software with the display I am using.  Before having a case for this, I had burned out the Adafruit SSD1306 I2C OLED display I was using.  To complete the project, I switched to a standard HD44780-style display I had laying around.  This will require quite a few more pins to control, and need to switch out the library used.  On the other hand, this appears to save significant memory space, as the Adafruit OLED board used a buffer in memory instead of sending text to the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixing warnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the functionality beyond the basic signal generator function has not been thoroughly tested, and after my most recent look at the code, I saw it was generating an error about copying the memory string name and a bunch of type conversion warnings.  These took a few minutes to fix after googling to fill in my lack of C++ knowledge.  There is still one warning about an unusued variable for the maximum memory slot, which I'll need to go back and ensure the memory mode loops through frequencies correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="radio"></category></entry><entry><title>Remote Control Power Supply</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/remote-control-power-supply.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2022-02-05:/remote-control-power-supply.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to operate my HF radio station remotely for the last month, using Windows Remote Desktop and &lt;a class="external" href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html"&gt;WSJT-X&lt;/a&gt; to sit and make some FT8 contacts while drinking my morning coffee.  This has worked well but I want to remove the step of having to remember to turn off my radio when I am done.  The power supply and radio are mounted in a closed cabinet.  Leaving the cabinet open invites exploration by our feline companion, while leaving it shut and powered up for long periods of time may result in the temperature rising more than I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered a simple relay board and decided to put it inside of my power supply, to be triggered by a program on the computer to turn the station on and off.  West Mountain Radio sells &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.westmountainradio.com/product_info.php?products_id=rr_4005i"&gt;a network connected control and monitor system&lt;/a&gt; with Power Pole connectors that would be great for this, but it's also $280 which is a lot more than I want to spend for this little effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend after getting all the parts, I took a few moments out in my shop to drill out some holes and mount the relay board, and wire the relay into the circuit of the power supply.  I had selected a relay that is adequate for the AC side of the power supply, which are more commonly available on a premade board than those capable of handling 12V/25A.  I made a few mistakes wiring it up, first mistakenly wiring it in series with the light inside the switch, and then wiring it to be normally closed when the relay is not powered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="relay mounted in power supply" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_insidea.jpg"&gt;.
&lt;img alt="relay close up" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_relay_closeupa.jpg"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final mistake I made was wiring up connector that I put on the back of my power supply.  I had decided to use a 1/8" TRS connector to provide power, ground, and signal to the relay from the control board, but instead of soldering to the tip and ring pins, I soldered to pins used to indicate when the plug is removed!  I connected ground to the shield, power to the ring, and signal to the tip, figuring this would ensure the least bad results if any of the pins made contact while inserting the plug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bad plug wiring" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\power_supply_plug_to_fixa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fixing the misconnected pins on the TRS socket, I needed to wire this up to my computer somehow.  My temporary solution is to use an old Arduino (which has been flaky to program) to provide +5V and ground to power the relay whenever my computer is connected to it.  Longer term, I am planning to develop a shack control board and software that can use an Arduino or similar board to monitor and control several aspects of my shack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="radio"></category></entry><entry><title>My Ham Shack</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/my-ham-shack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2022-01-21:/my-ham-shack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My home shack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a remote antenna switch, and commercial models seem to be expensive relative to what I am willing to spend.  I planned to combine an Arduino, ethernet shield with power over ethernet, and a board with four relays.  This assumes that commonly available relay boards would work fine for switching HF signals, providing both adequate isolation (separation when an antenna is turned off) and have minimal losses when in use.  I had planned to add on remote control for an automatic antenna tuner and an antenna rotator, but those two features will be for some future iteration of the project.  I have at least two HF antennas I wanted to connect, a short G5RV and a two element 6M beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Micrcontroller&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running into issues with a standard Arduino Uno and ethernet shield - there wasn't enough memory to serve up a minimal HTML page via HTTP to control the switch.  I looked at some successful projects using networked Arduinos for remote control, like the &lt;a class="external" href="https://opensprinkler.com/"&gt;OpenSprinkler&lt;/a&gt;, finding the source code was more optimized than I thought I could get for a one-off hobby project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next idea was to look at something like the Arduino YÃºn, which I discovered was unavailable at tthe time.  I did find Adafruit selling a clone called the &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3034"&gt;Seeeduino Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, marked as compatible with the YÃºn, and bought a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3785"&gt;Power over Ethernet (POE)&lt;/a&gt;.  I would not recommend the Seeeduino Cloud as it uses a custom branch of the OpenWRT Linux distribution that several years since having any kind of update, and minimal documentation.  So I set up two parts - a static HTML page with JavaScript for interactivity, served up by the Seeeduino's Linux side, and used the Arduino YunBridge library with a REST API to turn the appropriate pins for each relay on and off.  It works &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, but can be a bit buggy when the Arduino loses it's connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relay board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mounted a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/4-channel-5v-relay-module"&gt;Sainsmart relay board&lt;/a&gt; and Seeeduino into an old project box I had bought years ago for a manual antenna switch and never implemented.  I built a small RF sheild around the relay board using an old piece of aluminum bent to fit around it, and wired it up using some speaker wire and panel mount &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_connector"&gt;SO239 connectors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had considered their relay board with a &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/relays/products/rj45-tcp-ip-remote-control-board-with-integrated-8-ch-relay"&gt;built-in web server&lt;/a&gt;, but this was out of stock at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't tell if there is &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; isolation between these.  I used a friend's NanoVNA to find minimal losses on each of the connectors when selected, but I cannot hear any difference between connectors on the radio with one antenna hooked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next steps will be to rewire the relay board to directly solder to the PCB with short stubs of 14 gage copper wire to each connector and see if this works better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antenna Rotator?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbor, another ham, gave me a TV antenna rotator and homebrew controller.  The controller requires a five wire connection to the rotator, three for power and two to measure voltage across a potentiometer that indicates direction.  I had planned to incorporate controlling the rotator into the initial project until I started to investiate how to provide power to it.  The antenna rotator obviously requires more power to operate than I could deliver over PoE.  The homebrew controller provides 40V AC from a substanial transformer connected 110V AC.  The 40V AC appears to need to be reversed to rotate the controller in opposite directions, meaning four relays need to be used as a DPDT switch.  By the time I configure this, I still need to provide at least three wires up to the rotator, plus the ethernet to the Seeeduino.  I am not sure I'll complete this, instead I am planning to run 18 gauge, 7 conductor, sprinkler wire to the rotator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antenna Tuner?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary to the antenna switch and rotator controller, I wanted to connect either my LDG Z100 autotuner or another autotuner to the Seeeduino.  Locating the tuner near the antenna switch would allow me to minimize the impedance mismatch over the majority of my feedline, about 50ft from my shack to the mast on my garage.  The controls for the LDG autotuner appear to be pretty minimal, using a four pin connector from my Icom radio, esentially power and ground, and two pins communicate when to tune and status of tuning.  This should be easy to add at a future point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="radio"></category></entry><entry><title>Meteor Scatter Station</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/meteor-scatter-station.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-09T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2021-12-09:/meteor-scatter-station.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those magical things that has kept me interested in ham radio all these years has been the idea of bouncing signals off of things, particularly those in space.  I've long wanted to give meteor scatter a try, so I want to get my station set up for that this winter.  It seems much more within reach than satellite operations (next on my list) or &lt;a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%E2%80%93Moon%E2%80%93Earth_communication"&gt;EME communication&lt;/a&gt;.  Satellite repeaters requiring specialized antennas or at least good timing and knowing where to point a handheld antenna, while EME requiring some amplifiers outside of my budget for this hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears I can use a 2-element beam for 50MHz that my neighbor gave me, along with my IC-706MKIIG radio, and the WSJT-X software.  I want to mount the 50MHz antenna on a mast over my garage, and then get the software and radio set up to try some meteor scatter contacts in the morning before my kid gets up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago we decided to move our vegetable garden to the front yard, with the goal of reducing the amount of lawn we had and making use of one of the sunnier and less utilized spots in our yard.  Our existing raised beds had been build by a previous owner, placed in the shaddow of a tall hedge running around the back yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are about 11 inches deep, and roughly 4 feet across for easy access.  We had planned to use these for the &lt;a class="internal" href="squarefootgardening.org/"&gt;"Square Foot Gardening" method&lt;/a&gt;, but since decided that our root vegetables all end up too small due to being crowded.  The boxes are filled with a planting mix from one of our &lt;a class="external" href="http://wenzelnursery.com/"&gt;local garden centers&lt;/a&gt; composed of equal parts soil, mulch, and composted cow manure, which has worked great for growing vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since building the first two, I've added two more, and are planning to build two more this winter.  With the four we have we were getting quite a few fresh vegetables and freezing some for the winter.  Six will probably be enough for our family for a while.  They won't entirely replace purchases from the farmers market and grocery store -- there are some veggies that are too tedious to grow.  We mostly stick to tomatoes, peppers, squash, and a few root vegetables.  Leafy greens are difficult to keep pest free, especially from leaf miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sliding dovetail joint&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="garden boxes sliding dovetail joint detail" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\garden_box_dovetaila.jpg"&gt;
I had to search a bit to find one that looked good, most look sloppier than this but are holding up well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built these from my own plans out of cedar, using a sliding dovetail joint to attach the sides.  The first time I borrowed a router from a friend and tediously used the only dovetail bit he had to make four passes through the slot to enlarge it to an adequately sized slot for the boards to slide into.  I had built a little fence jig to attach to my friend's router to help with this.  The next year I bought a large dovetail bit and my own router, doing all eight corner pieces at once.  The slot was not quite straight doing this even with a commercial mortising jig, and usually ends up a little loose.  I often tack the boards in place with a brad nailer just to hold them together until I can put soil inside, at which point the pressure on the walls pushes everything into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I am going to try individual pieces again, but using a router table.  In previous years as well as this year, I need to make several passes with a narrow straight cutting bit to cut the 3/4" deep hole before making a final pass to carve out the dovetail walls.  I'll let you all know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wood"></category></entry><entry><title>Homemade house numbers - or, is a CNC machine worth it?</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/homemade-house-numbers-or-is-a-cnc-machine-worth-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-04T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2021-12-04:/homemade-house-numbers-or-is-a-cnc-machine-worth-it.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Around the time I started to get into woodworking, I bought a &lt;a class="external" href="https://wiki.shapeoko.com/index.php/ShapeOko_2"&gt;Shapeoko2 CNC machine&lt;/a&gt; during their crowdfunding campaign.

I had mostly planned to use it for electronics projects, milling single layer circuit boards and making simple enclosures.  My in-laws then asked for larger than normal house numbers as a holiday gift.  They lived in a retirement community the time and claimed the house numbers were too hard to read from a distance.  I took this as a good opportunity to learn how to use the machine and required software, I could mill them out of MDF and then give them a good coat of an acrylic spraypaint to seal them against the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="house numbers for inlaws" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\house_numbers_2760a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might have been one of a few CNC projects I completed, I can't actually think of the others.  For a number of reason, I sold the machine and bought a bunch of more traditional woodworking equipment instead.  Since lots of people have compared CNC versus traditional woodworking techniques, I won't try to recap all the differences here.  A quick search on YouTube will yield lots of videos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the thing that made me sell the machine was the software.  At the time I was using Linux on all my home computers, and the CNC ecosystem for Linux wasn't great.  &lt;a class="external" href="https://librecad.org/"&gt;LibreCAD&lt;/a&gt; is a decent CAD package for two dimensional work, and did a good job for design work.  The Shapeoko's GRBL controller, paired with Universal G-code Sender software worked well for controlling the machine.  The challenge I had was finding a good Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software to convert the 2D CAD drawings to the G-code that tells the what to do. With good reason, this is a challenging bit of software to develop - there are a lot of (literal) moving parts.  Unfortunately, sticking to the Linux environment, the available options were all pretty sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I've kind of decided to keep computer's out of my shop.  I'd like to learn techniques (both with power and hand tools) that let me use my brain and my hands to build something.  I spend a lot of my work day in front of a computer screen, and I didn't want to add &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; hobby that kept me sitting in front of a glowing rectangle.  And the original goal of milling circuit boards - someday I want to learn some of the old-school homebrew techniques for building circuits (like Manhattan or dead-bug style construction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I bought a scroll saw - it's one of several tools that, depending on the size and material) replaced my need for a CNC machine.  It wasn't a great purchase, but I did a few projects with it.  It's a lot faster to print out my design, tack it onto a board, and cut out than it would take me to go through using a buggy piece of CAM software and upload it to the machine.  I ended up doing another set of house numbers using the scroll saw, and I think they came out just as nice as the CNC product would be.  Of course, I ending up &lt;a class="internal" href="toy-cars.html"&gt;getting rid of the scroll saw&lt;/a&gt;, but if I had to do this project again, I would pick up another cheap one over trying to find someone with a CNC machine.&lt;/p&gt;

There is an obvious gap between the front and back halfs, where a hole was framed up and cut open  I've long wanted to make my shop more usable in the winter by dividing it off from the garage.  Every winter I use a few electric heaters to warm it up each day that I want to use it.  While I would like to insulate the walls someday, I'm starting with cutting the space to heat in half as a quick way to make the space heaters more effective.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend I framed out a wall, hung a couple of interior doors that were in the garage rafters when I moved in, and used a sheet of fiberboard cover one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next steps are to close off the right hand side with a plexiglass window to allow a little light and visibilty between halves of the garage.  Then I want to put up some trim to make the doors look a bit more professional and seal off the edges.  And they all need a good cleaning from the dust that has accumulated on them over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

Two of the four cutting boards I made shown next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making a big end grain cutting board a way of saying thanks to a good friend who catered our baby shower and learned a lot of things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="end grain cutting boards" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\cutting_boardsa.jpg"&gt;
Two of the four cutting boards I made shown next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making a big end grain cutting board a way of saying thanks to a good friend who catered our baby shower and learned a lot of things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to make these big and heavy, with a high contrast checkerboard pattern using one-inch squares as a reference for cutting vegetables.  I was going to make a pair and keep the worse one for myself.  This way I would have two chances at everything, and end up with a nice big cutting board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the required amount of hard maple and black walnut for this approach only to find out that the black walnut was a lot more difficult to work with.  In particular, cutting the strips of black walnut on my table saw was resulting in the wood binding around the blade, both causing the resulting strip to come out with a bow in it, and stopping the blade, causing the circuit breaker to trip and the lights to go out.  I tried a few upgrades, including putting the ribbing knife back in place (always a good idea!) and buying a rip blade, as I had only been using a combination blade so far.  I also used it as sign that I should upgrade the electrical wiring in my shop, as previously the whole garage was on a single 20A circuit.  I also switched to using a red cherry wood instead of the black walnut.  The contrast between the cherry and maple wasn't quite as impressive, but it looks better than the original would have come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hand planed most of the 1x1 strips after cutting them down to just a bit oversized.  This was tedious work that I could have easily done with a good setup on the tablesaw, but also really good practice at using a handplane.  Some of the lack of perfect intersections in the grid are due to my planing being a little off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cutting board strips ready to glue up" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\cutting_board_stripsa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cutting board strips glued up and clamped" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\cutting_board_slab_glue_upa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gluing up the strips into a slab, I cross-cut them with my table saw to two inch width sections.  These sections would then be turned end grain up and glued on facegrain in alternating pairs to create the checkerboard effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took these cross-cut sections over to another woodworking friend's shop to use his planer to get them right to just to 1" wide in this dimension.  Using the planeer was not a great idea.  Running the sections through the planer, which could only be done across the grain at this poin, ended up creating all kinds of problems.  As a result, I lost about a third of the cross-cut sections!  The first problem was going across the grain caused a lot of tear-out and breaking segments as it passed under the cutters.  The fibers that were planed off were not short, but 2" long bits of wood, which quickly clogged the planer and chip collector it was hooked up to.  At some point during the session I found out my friend had not really used the planer much since buying it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got these back to my shop, I glued the face grain sides together, alternating the two types of sections to create the checkerboard pattern.  This took a lot of clamps, cauls, and patience.  Finally I sanded them successively to 220 grit, put a slight roundover on every side, and oiled them with butchers block oil.  My spouse thought I was a little obsessed with how nice they looked after all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a second set&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was finishing the big checkerboard set, I ended up doing another pair using the scraps of walnut, with a little bit of the cherry and maple for contrast.  I only used my hand planes to shape these, but as I wasn't going for perfect 1" square strips, I was able to get a little more creative in the pattern.  I glued up three different slabs, crosscut them, and then mixed and matched, flipping and shifting the pieces to get a more random looking pattern to them.  After making both sets of cutting boards, I really like these a whole lot better.  I kept a slightly smaller one and gave the larger of these to a friend who was moving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big one is just a little too heavy (1.5" thick, surface area is 11" by 10").  It is a great size for heavy-duty project cooking where lots of vegetable prep is needed, but a little too heavy to want to get out day-to-day cooking.  I am glad I didn't make it any bigger by surface area, like I would have if I hadn't lost so many pieces to the power planer.  If I made one again, I would target closer to 1" thick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The small one is just a little too small (8.5" by 5") to use for much, but regularly gets used for cutting up fruit or cheese, or when we just need to dice one or two cups of a veggie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My bigger one is a bit warped due to me being hasty while gluing it up, so I use a towel or piece of drawer liner under it to help keep it from rocking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After their first wash the grain got raised a little bit by the water causing them to loose a bit of their smoothness.  I sanded these a second time which took care of the rough texture.  If I ever make another one as a gift, I want to remember to do this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both get used almost every day!  It was a great project to learn a lot about woodworking, and I'd recommend anyone wanting to do a useful project.&lt;/li&gt;

I bought one #4 plane from Harbor Freight during my cutting board project to help square up the strips.  I figured it was a lot cheaper than buying a planer or other pieces of power equipment.  In trying to make it actually work, I found out these are still serious tools, and lots of craftsman do really amazing woodworking by hand.  While there are a number of YouTube channels dedicated to hand tool woodworking, the one I most recommend is &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RexKrueger/"&gt;Rex Kruger (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;.  He has a bunch of great videos about restoring and using old and cheap tools, and does a great job explaining the how and why of these tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Harbor Freight No. 4 "Scrub" Plane&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first plane I bought and found impossible to use out of the box.  (a plane, from harbor freight, that wasn't ready to go?  you don't say...)  I later gave the blade a heavy camber to use it as a scrub plane which it does really well at due to the wide throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I modified &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/littlest-helper-tower"&gt;these plans from Ana White&lt;/a&gt; by removing the arch shape and using mortise and tenon joints instead of the pocket screws.  I could have easily done it with the pocket screws and had a great result, but I  wanted to challenge myself doing a whole bunch of morises and tenons joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this project to practice making mortise and tenon joints, as my first real project (besides my &lt;a class="internal" href="workbench-and-stand.html"&gt;miter saw stand&lt;/a&gt;) used a tenon jig that I made to fit over the fence of my table saw.  The mortises were made using my drill press.  I assembled two of the sides before adding the mortises for the biggest side panels, and drilling out the mortises on these pieces with the drill press was the most awkward step.  The tenon jig was not perfect - I had to constantly apply a sideways pressure into the fence to keep it from wobbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tenon jig made from MDF and toggle clamp" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\tenon_jiga.jpg"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great project, and with the mortise and tenon joints it gave me a chance to challenge myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustable floor has worked well as my kid has grown.  We probably won't use it all the way to the bottom rung, as a step stool might work just as well at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="learning tower in progress, unpainted" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\learning_tower_constructiona.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint about the project is that I used some housepaint to finish it.  I would have left it with just wood finish, but there were a number of blemishes in the wood when I bought it and more that I added while planing the pieces.  I patched these with some wood filler.  I put the paint on in a way that left a lot of drips and blops.  Since it is used by a preschooler for all kinds of snacks and other activities, it been picking up all kinds of smudges and dirt, and I haven't found a good cleaner that actually removes them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wood"></category></entry><entry><title>Toy cars</title><link href="https://www.indiahotelxray.org/toy-cars.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-11-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>eheisman</name></author><id>tag:www.indiahotelxray.org,2021-11-26:/toy-cars.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to make more wooden toys for my kid, and after purchasing a used scroll saw, I was able to make a couple of toy cars like this out of some scrap elm I had in the shop.

I had bought the wheels from a wood supply shop in Portland on a visit, although I think any chain craft store might have them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up making two, the one pictured below, and a newer one with a few small issues addressed.  The length of the axles and the roundness of the axle holes is critical to get them to roll well, the second car I made works much better.  The photo of the car being finished shows how I messed up drilling the hole for the front axle, it is not quite round.  The second car also had some paste wax applied to the inside of the axle holes before assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remaining issue is the size of these cars - they ended up being just a little too big for my kid to play with when I made them (around 18 months old).  I would reduce the size by about a third in all dimensions if I ever make more of these.  The wheels already look a little too big, but I think having them be a more managable size would make them more fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I got rid of the scroll saw --  I had bought it used, without any blades.  As the owner demonstrated it and told me his mother-in-law had used it for some crafts, I thought it was good to go.  After getting it home and set up, I noticed a few parts showed some damage to the blade holder that made it rattle when in use, and difficult to tension.  As a result I broke quite a few blades trying to complete these toy cars and another project.  I might have been able to craft a few replacement parts, but decided it was a better use of my time to practice with a coping or turning saw for these kinds of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, I realized I was going to need a better desk to continue working from home with, so I decided it was time to finally build one.  This had been a goal of mine when getting into woodworking, but given the circumstances, I thought it was a good time to take a first shot at one.  I ended up building something like a basic table, a little larger than most commercial desks, and gave it legs and supports at the far sides.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desk-top is assembled from pieces of locally source cherry that I joined with a borrowed biscuit joiner and then planed flat.  I put a slight half-inch bevel around the outside with a handplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top came out great - I really took the time to learn to handplane it smooth and finish with shellac.  It has a few blemishes from places where the grain switches direction and my handplaning messed it up, but not bad for my first try at a 'tabletop'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I'd like to improve about this desk in the future: 
- The legs ended up being extremely light weight and quickly thrown together, and while they serve their purpose, someday I want to replace them with something more study.  It's also about two inches too high.  The biggest reason the legs ended up the way they did was that I didn't buy enough wood to begin with.
- It doesn't have any storage.  As shown in the photo, I have some milk crates holding various things and a printer under it.  Someday I might build a portable cabinet that fits under it and holds these kind of things.
- I'd like to add a tray or shelf near the back to help with cable organization and to hold up my laptop and monitor at the same level.  Maybe for cable organization to add a tray under the desk surface and use desk grommets to provide access for cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans I had sketched out show some of these additional features and how I'd really like to do the legs - I'm including them below (without commentary) as a friend had asked about my design process.&lt;/p&gt;

I made the box from a piece of western red cedar from the lumberyard, and with the help of my dad got it tied up to the tree.  It has been up for a few years, although we only had an owl visit once to get shelter from a snowstorm.  So far, it's mostly be home to the yard's resident squirels.&lt;/p&gt;

I figure shop furniture is a great place to learn new techniques without worrying about aesthetics.  I often use construction lumber and recycled materials for these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Miter saw stand&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first attempt at mortise and tenon joints.  A friend gave me the cabinet drawers out of a kitchen he was remodeling, which worked perfectly for adding some storage to this project.  I used my drill press to hog out the mortises and a set of chisels to clean them up.  I built a basic tenon jig for my table saw.  Both were pretty rough and I was worried the whole assembly wouldn't go together well after a test fit.  I had planned for side panels made from peg board for storing additional tools and sawblades, and once I added these, the whole thing was a lot more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the bigger drawers near the bottom for storing various smaller tools and jigs, and the top drawer for all my screws, nails, and other fasteners.  I made a simple set of dividers from some MDF and stuck them down in there.  This mostly works well, but it is an odd place to put all of those.
&lt;img alt="miter saw stand shown from the front" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\2019-11-26 20.02.53_miter_saw_standa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castors on the bottom are also a bit funky, I had put two with swivels and two without, to save some money, but this arrangement doesn't provide much maneuverability when moving around the shop.  As a result, I often end up lifting one side off the ground to roll it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Workbench&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built this workbench without knowing what I was doing and has grown organically with my needs.  The base was &lt;a class="external" href="https://woodgears.ca/workbench/"&gt;inspired by Matthias Wandel's plans&lt;/a&gt; while the top was roughly in the english-style bench... but I would call it a picnic table top.  I've since added a vise, tool well, more bracing, and some extra shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's due to be replaced someday as it is a little shakey and the top is slightly warped due to a slight twist to the frame.  I've tried planing the top a few times, and it is free of any big bumps, but the warp/twist is a bit of problem when working on large panels.  It'll probably get repurposed as another bench for gardening or light metal work when I do replace it.  I've since added more bracing to the back to keep it from racking when I am really vigorously planing a piece of wood, and another storage shelf for tools.  There is also a tool well off to one side of the bench that I use for storing various bits of workholding gear like bench dogs and holdfasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="workbench as originally built" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\2018-04-28 15.00.30a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harbor Freight carpenters vise that I started with is great for small pieces, but sticks up over the edge of the bench.
To help fix this, I built a very simple vise from a piece of hard maple, and two 8" long 3/4" diameter bolts which a friend welded handles onto.  The rough idea was from &lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr7RKz8V4Y8"&gt;One Minute Woodworking's video on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, although looking back at it, my plans have the bolts mounted backwards from theirs.  It was dirt cheap, the maple might have been the most expensive piece.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets plenty of grip for handplaning and helping hold pieces to the bench, but turning both handles to tighten and loosen it can be a little tedious.  The handles on the bolts get in the way sometime, next time I would do some kind of wooden knobs and epoxy them on.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RexKrueger/"&gt;Rex Kruger (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt; - Rex's videos really taught me how to sharpen and use handplanes and I really appreciate his approach to making woodworking with hand tools more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin"&gt;Steve Ramsey (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt; - Lots of good introductory videos for power tool woodworking&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a civil engineer (water resources engineer) by training who has been doing more and more software engineering work.  My job consists of maintaining and upgrading computer models of watersheds and reserviors.  When I am not doing that, I dabble in &lt;a class="internal" href="category/wood.html"&gt;woodworking&lt;/a&gt;, birding, organic gardening, photography, and &lt;a class="internal" href="category/radio.html"&gt;ham â€¦&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What do I want to do here:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of ongoing hobby projects, provide myself some accountability on them.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one post per project, updated as it progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;share information or thoughts relevant to those projects&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kind of a public version of my personal OneNote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post less on social media and more on the old-web&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of interesting things I read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about the old blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;a class="external" href="https://eaheisman.blogspot.com"&gt;that one with three or four posts about reading HEC-DSS files in R?&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm going to leave that up for now with comments turned off, but most of the content is on &lt;a class="external" href="https://github.com/eheisman"&gt;my github profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why the blog name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phonetic alphabet for the last three letters of my amateur radio callsign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What, no comments?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, no comments.

&lt;li&gt;get a decent theme working&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turns out your pelican-themes directory needs to actually have themes in it!  I naively cloned the &lt;code&gt;pelican-themes&lt;/code&gt; github repo and got empty directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make markdown first level headers slightly smaller than post title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; css to make slightly smaller than â€¦&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;TODO items (updated occasionally)&lt;/h1&gt;

Tried adding a second css file to template's base.html.  Learned about the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator in css.  New css file works well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert header image - on hold&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to modify base.html template; identify file, add static image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload a few photos of woodworking projects - in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload some short descriptions of programming projects - in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add caption style using &lt;code&gt;img + p&lt;/code&gt; in css&lt;/li&gt;
