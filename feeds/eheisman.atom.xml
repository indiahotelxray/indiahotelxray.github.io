Two of the four cutting boards I made shown next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making a big end grain cutting board a way of saying thanks to a good friend who catered our baby shower and learned a lot of things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="end grain cutting boards" src="./images/cutting_boards.jpg"&gt;
Two of the four cutting boards I made shown next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making a big end grain cutting board a way of saying thanks to a good friend who catered our baby shower and learned a lot of things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to make these big and heavy, with a high contrast checkerboard pattern using one-inch squares as a reference for cutting vegetables.  I was going to make a pair and keep the worse one for myself.  This way I would have two chances at everything, and end up with a nice big cutting board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the required amount of hard maple and black walnut for this approach only to find out that the black walnut was a lot more difficult to work with.  In particular, cutting the strips of black walnut on my table saw was resulting in the wood binding around the blade, both causing the resulting strip to come out with a bow in it, and stopping the blade, causing the circuit breaker to trip and the lights to go out.  I tried a few upgrades, including putting the ribbing knife back in place (always a good idea!) and buying a rip blade, as I had only been using a combination blade so far.  I also used it as sign that I should upgrade the electrical wiring in my shop, as previously the whole garage was on a single 20A circuit.  I also switched to using a red cherry wood instead of the black walnut.  The contrast between the cherry and maple wasn't quite as impressive, but it looks better than the original would have come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hand planed most of the 1x1 strips after cutting them down to just a bit oversized.  This was tedious work that I could have easily done with a good setup on the tablesaw, but also really good practice at using a handplane.  Some of the lack of perfect intersections in the grid are due to my planing being a little off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cutting board strips ready to glue up" src="images/cutting_board_strips.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cutting board strips glued up and clamped" src="images/cutting_board_slab_glue_up.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gluing up the strips into a slab, I cross-cut them with my table saw to two inch width sections.  These sections would then be turned end grain up and glued on facegrain in alternating pairs to create the checkerboard effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took these cross-cut sections over to another woodworking friend's shop to use his planer to get them right to just to 1" wide in this dimension.  Using the planeer was not a great idea.  Running the sections through the planer, which could only be done across the grain at this poin, ended up creating all kinds of problems.  As a result, I lost about a third of the cross-cut sections!  The first problem was going across the grain caused a lot of tear-out and breaking segments as it passed under the cutters.  The fibers that were planed off were not short, but 2" long bits of wood, which quickly clogged the planer and chip collector it was hooked up to.  At some point during the session I found out my friend had not really used the planer much since buying it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got these back to my shop, I glued the face grain sides together, alternating the two types of sections to create the checkerboard pattern.  This took a lot of clamps, cauls, and patience.  Finally I sanded them successively to 220 grit, put a slight roundover on every side, and oiled them with butchers block oil.  My spouse thought I was a little obsessed with how nice they looked after all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making a second set&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was finishing the big checkerboard set, I ended up doing another pair using the scraps of walnut, with a little bit of the cherry and maple for contrast.  I only used my hand planes to shape these, but as I wasn't going for perfect 1" square strips, I was able to get a little more creative in the pattern.  I glued up three different slabs, crosscut them, and then mixed and matched, flipping and shifting the pieces to get a more random looking pattern to them.  After making both sets of cutting boards, I really like these a whole lot better.  I kept a slightly smaller one and gave the larger of these to a friend who was moving away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big one is just a little too heavy (1.5" thick, surface area is 11" by 10").  It is a great size for heavy-duty project cooking where lots of vegetable prep is needed, but a little too heavy to want to get out day-to-day cooking.  I am glad I didn't make it any bigger by surface area, like I would have if I hadn't lost so many pieces to the power planer.  If I made one again, I would target closer to 1" thick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The small one is just a little too small (8.5" by 5") to use for much, but regularly gets used for cutting up fruit or cheese, or when we just need to dice one or two cups of a veggie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My bigger one is a bit warped due to me being hasty while gluing it up, so I use a towel or piece of drawer liner under it to help keep it from rocking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After their first wash the grain got raised a little bit by the water causing them to loose a bit of their smoothness.  I sanded these a second time which took care of the rough texture.  If I ever make another one as a gift, I want to remember to do this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both get used almost every day!  It was a great project to learn a lot about woodworking, and I'd recommend anyone wanting to do a useful project.&lt;/li&gt;

I bought one #4 plane from Harbor Freight during my cutting board project to help square up the strips.  I figured it was a lot cheaper than buying a planer or other pieces of power equipment.  In trying to make it actually work, I found out these are still serious tools, and lots of craftsman do really amazing woodworking by hand.  While there are a number of YouTube channels dedicated to hand tool woodworking, the one I most recommend is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RexKrueger/"&gt;Rex Kruger (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;.  He has a bunch of great videos about restoring and using old and cheap tools, and does a great job explaining the how and why of these tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Harbor Freight No. 4 "Scrub" Plane&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first plane I bought and found impossible to use out of the box.  (a plane, from harbor freight, that wasn't ready to go?  you don't say...)  I later gave the blade a heavy camber to use it as a scrub plane which it does really well at due to the wide throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dunlop No. 4 Smoothing Plane&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely belonged to my grandfather.  I love using this plane, it works really well for finishing a project.&lt;/p&gt;

I had bought the wheels from a wood supply shop in Portland on a visit, although I think any chain craft store might have them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up making two, the one pictured below, and a newer one with a few small issues addressed.  The length of the axles and the roundness of the axle holes is critical to get them to roll well, the second car I made works much better.  The photo of the car being finished shows how I messed up drilling the hole for the front axle, it is not quite round.  The second car also had some paste wax applied to the inside of the axle holes before assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One remaining issue is the size of these cars - they ended up being just a little too big for my kid to play with when I made them (around 18 months old).  I would reduce the size by about a third in all dimensions if I ever make more of these.  The wheels already look a little too big, but I think having them be a more managable size would make them more fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I got rid of the scroll saw --  I had bought it used, without any blades.  As the owner demonstrated it and told me his mother-in-law had used it for some crafts, I thought it was good to go.  After getting it home and set up, I noticed a few parts showed some damage to the blade holder that made it rattle when in use, and difficult to tension.  As a result I broke quite a few blades trying to complete these toy cars and another project.  I might have been able to craft a few replacement parts, but decided it was a better use of my time to practice with a coping or turning saw for these kinds of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2020, I realized I was going to need a better desk to continue working from home with, so I decided it was time to finally build one.  This had been a goal of mine when getting into woodworking, but given the circumstances, I thought it was a good time to take a first shot at one.  I ended up building something like a basic table, a little larger than most commercial desks, and gave it legs and supports at the far sides.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desk-top is assembled from pieces of locally source cherry that I joined with a borrowed biscuit joiner and then planed flat.  I put a slight half-inch bevel around the outside with a handplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top came out great - I really took the time to learn to handplane it smooth and finish with shellac.  It has a few blemishes from places where the grain switches direction and my handplaning messed it up, but not bad for my first try at a 'tabletop'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I'd like to improve about this desk in the future: 
- The legs ended up being extremely light weight and quickly thrown together, and while they serve their purpose, someday I want to replace them with something more study.  It's also about two inches too high.  The biggest reason the legs ended up the way they did was that I didn't buy enough wood to begin with.
- It doesn't have any storage.  As shown in the photo, I have some milk crates holding various things and a printer under it.  Someday I might build a portable cabinet that fits under it and holds these kind of things.
- I'd like to add a tray or shelf near the back to help with cable organization and to hold up my laptop and monitor at the same level.  Maybe for cable organization to add a tray under the desk surface and use desk grommets to provide access for cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans I had sketched out show some of these additional features and how I'd really like to do the legs - I'm including them below (without commentary) as a friend had asked about my design process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Miter saw stand&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first attempt at mortise and tenon joints.  A friend gave me the cabinet drawers out of a kitchen he was remodeling, which worked perfectly for adding some storage to this project.  I used my drill press to hog out the mortises and a set of chisels to clean them up.  I built a basic tenon jig for my table saw.  Both were pretty rough and I was worried the whole assembly wouldn't go together well after a test fit.  I had planned for side panels made from peg board for storing additional tools and sawblades, and once I added these, the whole thing was a lot more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the bigger drawers near the bottom for storing various smaller tools and jigs, and the top drawer for all my screws, nails, and other fasteners.  I made a simple set of dividers from some MDF and stuck them down in there.  This mostly works well, but it is an odd place to put all of those.
&lt;img alt="miter saw stand shown from the front" src="./images/2019-11-26 20.02.53_miter_saw_stand.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castors on the bottom are also a bit funky, I had put two with swivels and two without, to save some money, but this arrangement doesn't provide much maneuverability when moving around the shop.  As a result, I often end up lifting one side off the ground to roll it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Workbench&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built this workbench without knowing what I was doing and has grown organically with my needs.  The base was &lt;a href="https://woodgears.ca/workbench/"&gt;inspired by Matthias Wandel's plans&lt;/a&gt; while the top was roughly in the english-style bench... but I would call it a picnic table top.  I've since added a vise, tool well, more bracing, and some extra shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's due to be replaced someday as it is a little shakey and the top is slightly warped due to a slight twist to the frame.  I've tried planing the top a few times, and it is free of any big bumps, but the warp/twist is a bit of problem when working on large panels.  It'll probably get repurposed as another bench for gardening or light metal work when I do replace it.  I've since added more bracing to the back to keep it from racking when I am really vigorously planing a piece of wood, and another storage shelf for tools.  There is also a tool well off to one side of the bench that I use for storing various bits of workholding gear like bench dogs and holdfasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="workbench as originally built" src="./images/2018-04-28 15.00.30.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harbor Freight carpenters vise that I started with is great for small pieces, but sticks up over the edge of the bench.
To help fix this, I built a very simple vise from a piece of hard maple, and two 8" long 3/4" diameter bolts which a friend welded handles onto.  The rough idea was from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr7RKz8V4Y8"&gt;One Minute Woodworking's video on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, although looking back at it, my plans have the bolts mounted backwards from theirs.  It was dirt cheap, the maple might have been the most expensive piece.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets plenty of grip for handplaning and helping hold pieces to the bench, but turning both handles to tighten and loosen it can be a little tedious.  The handles on the bolts get in the way sometime, next time I would do some kind of wooden knobs and epoxy them on.&lt;br&gt;

Every winter I use a few electric heaters to warm it up each day that I want to use it.  While I would like to insulate it and put up solid walls to hang stuff on, I'm starting with cutting the space to heat in half.&lt;/p&gt;

When I am not doing that, I dabble in &lt;a href="category/wood.html"&gt;woodworking&lt;/a&gt;, birding, organic gardening, photography, and &lt;a href="category/radio.html"&gt;ham radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What do I want to do here:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of ongoing hobby projects, provide myself some accountability on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;share information or thoughts relevant to those projects&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kind of a public version of my personal OneNote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post less on social media and more on the old-web&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep track of interesting things I read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about the old blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;a href="https://eaheisman.blogspot.com"&gt;that one with three or four posts about reading HEC-DSS files in R?&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm going to leave that up for now with comments turned off, but most of the content is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/eheisman"&gt;my github profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why the blog name?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phonetic alphabet for the last three letters of my amateur radio callsign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What are my short term goals for programming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a more modern IDE that I can use for work (Java, Python, R) and home (Python and R).  This probably means Visual Studio Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally upgrade to skills to Python 3 (in 2021! I mean... 2022!)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;get a decent theme working&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turns out your pelican-themes directory needs to actually have themes in it!  I naively cloned the &lt;code&gt;pelican-themes&lt;/code&gt; github repo and got empty directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make markdown first level headers slightly smaller than post title.&lt;/li&gt;

Tried adding a second css file to template's base.html.  Learned about the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator in css.  New css file works well enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert header image - on hold&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to modify base.html template; identify file, add static image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload a few photos of woodworking projects - in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload some short descriptions of programming projects - in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add caption style using &lt;code&gt;img + p&lt;/code&gt; in css&lt;/li&gt;
