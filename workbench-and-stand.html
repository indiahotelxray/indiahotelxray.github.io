                <p>Here's a few bits of shop furniture I've built and my thoughts about what I would do different next time.  I figure shop furniture is a great place to learn new techniques without worrying about aesthetics.  I often use construction lumber and recycled materials for these.</p>
<h1>Miter saw stand</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>This was my first attempt at mortise and tenon joints.  A friend gave me the cabinet drawers out of a kitchen he was remodeling, which worked perfectly for adding some storage to this project.  I used my drill press to hog out the mortises and a set of chisels to clean them up.  I built a basic tenon jig for my table saw.  Both were pretty rough and I was worried the whole assembly wouldn't go together well after a test fit.  I had planned for side panels made from peg board for storing additional tools and sawblades, and once I added these, the whole thing was a lot more stable.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I use the bigger drawers near the bottom for storing various smaller tools and jigs, and the top drawer for all my screws, nails, and other fasteners.  I made a simple set of dividers from some MDF and stuck them down in there.  This mostly works well, but it is an odd place to put all of those.

<p>The castors on the bottom are also a bit funky, I had put two with swivels and two without, to save some money, but this arrangement doesn't provide much maneuverability when moving around the shop.  As a result, I often end up lifting one side off the ground to roll it around.</p>
<h1>Workbench</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>I built this workbench without knowing what I was doing and has grown organically with my needs.  The base was <a class="external" href="https://woodgears.ca/workbench/">inspired by Matthias Wandel's plans</a> while the top was roughly in the english-style bench... but I would call it a picnic table top.  I've since added a vise, tool well, more bracing, and some extra shelves. </p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>It's due to be replaced someday as it is a little shakey and the top is slightly warped due to a slight twist to the frame.  I've tried planing the top a few times, and it is free of any big bumps, but the warp/twist is a bit of problem when working on large panels.  It'll probably get repurposed as another bench for gardening or light metal work when I do replace it.  I've since added more bracing to the back to keep it from racking when I am really vigorously planing a piece of wood, and another storage shelf for tools.  There is also a tool well off to one side of the bench that I use for storing various bits of workholding gear like bench dogs and holdfasts.</p>

<h2>Update - April 2022</h2>
<p>I am in the process of replacing the boards ontop of the workbench with some 2x6s on one side to provide a flatter surface for handplaning and provide more space for a planing stop.  In the process, I seem to be improving the stiffness of the workbench.  It has taken me a couple of one hour sessions to replace the boards.</p>
<h1>Vise</h1>
<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>The Harbor Freight carpenters vise that I started with is great for small pieces, but sticks up over the edge of the bench.
To help fix this, I built a very simple vise from a piece of hard maple, and two 8" long 3/4" diameter bolts which a friend welded handles onto.  The rough idea was from <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr7RKz8V4Y8">One Minute Woodworking's video on YouTube</a>, although looking back at it, my plans have the bolts mounted backwards from theirs.  It was dirt cheap, the maple might have been the most expensive piece.  </p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>It gets plenty of grip for handplaning and helping hold pieces to the bench, but turning both handles to tighten and loosen it can be a little tedious.  The handles on the bolts get in the way sometime, next time I would do some kind of wooden knobs and epoxy them on.<br>
