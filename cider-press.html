                <h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p>My house came with a beautiful old apple tree in the yard, probably dating to around the time the house was built (1950), which is incredibly prolific, meaning we get more apples than we can ever turn into baked goods and apple sauce in one year.  Several times I have tried making some kind of apple cider with the fruit from the tree, using various methods to avoid renting a press.  Here's my account of building a (not-so) quick and dirty cider press.  My goal isn't to build the most elegant fruit press ever, just something functional.</p>
<h2>Improvising a press screw</h2>
<p>I figure this is one of the more critical pieces, and where I was willing to spend the most money, but also wanted to avoid spending as much as a commercial press would cost to buy.  I started building the frame for a press years ago, with the idea to use a scissor jack to provide compression, but discovered that the one in my car wouldn't extend when a five gallon bucket was placed under it.  For several years I had considered buying a cheap bench screw online, but most of the ones for sale were too short, 18 inches long or less, which doesn't provide enough depth for this.  This weekend I finally broke down and ordered a few critical parts: a 24" 5/8-inch 11-tpi threaded rod made from stainless steel and accompanying nuts and washers.</p>
<p><img alt="cider press in progress" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\press_in_progress_20211231a.jpg"></p>
<p>The resulting press mechanism appears to work really well, or at least more smoothly than I was expecting.  One key thing I did was making sure the nut was well aligned with the hole that the threaded rod would go through.  I squeezed the nut that sits in the thrust block by first placing the rod in the nut, and then putting this through the thrust block on top of the pre-drilled frame.  This gave me a good ~8 inches or so of hole that helped align the whole mechanism as I used a mallet to force the nut into the slightly undersized hole I had drilled and chiseled out for it.  Note, don't use too much force here, the first thrust block was made of some cheap construction lumber and split during this step.  I made the second one with a piece of heavy elm.</p>
<p><img alt="thrust block as cut" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\cider_press_thrust_block_20211220a.jpg"></p>
<p>I mounted the thrust block with six countersunk screws, pre-drilling each hole to avoid having this piece crack.</p>
<h2>Building the bucket</h2>
<p>I took a five gallon bucket and attached some wooden staves and metal banding to strengthen it.  The staves were made from 1/3 width pieces of 2x4 and spaced evenly around the bucket.  The staves were attached to one piece of metal banding while laid out on my workbench, using a strip of wood as a guide to provide even spacing.  I then rolled around the bucket before straightening and attaching the second band.  These were then pressure fit over the bucket by gently tapping on a mallet until they were snug - I had sized the bands to give about an inch between the rim of the bucket and the top of the staves, giving me some space to tighten it this way but should still be removable.</p>

<p>I still need to drill some holes around the bottom to let the juice out.  I want to drill these in a way that is easy to clean up, so I am thinking of using a nice drill bit and taking it slow.  I should drill some test holes in another bucket first.</p>
<h2>Adding feet</h2>
<p><img alt="legs attached upside down" src="https://www.indiahotelxray.org\photos\leg_whoopsie_20221116a.jpg"></p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>I cut out the notch in them using the table saw and chisel.  The ends were done on the miter saw.  After getting it wrong the first time (see above), I took these off, recut the ends, and attached with glue and screws through the bottom.  The bottom of the frame is not very level as you can see in the photo, so I am hoping that these add much needed stability.</p>
<h2>Carving the handle</h2>
<p>I had tested the press screw with a piece of 2x4 that I carved a spot for a nut into, but I want the handle to be a little more ergonomic than this.  I started carving the handle after freehanding some curves (well, the bottom of the 5-gallon bucket) into each end, and took a 1-1/2" chisel to pare down to the line.  I cut a few relief cuts with various saws and found the wide-kerf rough-cutting one that came with my cheap miter box was the fastest at this.  Finally, I took a belt sander clamped to my workbench to help smooth this all out before coating in paste wax.</p>

<h2>Future steps</h2>
<p>I need to build the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>plate to apply pressure to the fruit,</li>
<li>a pan to collect the juice, _maybe an old half-sized rimmed baking sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I have that all done, I need to press some fruit.  I have five gallons of apples fermenting in a mini-fridge at the moment, which will be a good first test.  Following that, I know several friends with other fruits that I can use next year.</p>
