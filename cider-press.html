                <h2>The story so far...</h2>
<p>My house came with a beautiful old apple tree in the yard, probably dating to around the time the house was built (1950), which is incredibly prolific, meaning we get more apples than we can ever turn into baked goods and apple sauce in one year.  Several times I have tried making some kind of apple cider with the fruit from the tree, using various methods to avoid renting a press.  Here's my account of building a (not-so) quick and dirty cider press.</p>
<h2>Improvising a press screw</h2>
<p>I figure this is one of the more critical pieces, and where I was willing to spend the most money, but also wanted to avoid spending as much as a commercial press would cost to buy.  I started building the frame for a press years ago, with the idea to use a scissor jack to provide compression, but discovered that the one in my car wouldn't extend when a five gallon bucket was placed under it.  For several years I had considered buying a cheap bench screw online, but most of the ones for sale were too short, 18 inches long or less, which doesn't provide enough depth for this.  This weekend I finally broke down and ordered a few critical parts: a 24" 5/8-inch 11-tpi threaded rod made from stainless steel and accompanying nuts and washers.</p>
<p><img alt="cider press in progress" src="https://indiahotelxray.github.io\photos\cider_press_in_progress_20211220a.jpg"></p>
<p>The resulting press mechanism appears to work really well, or at least more smoothly than I was expecting.  One key thing I did was making sure the nut was well aligned with the hole that the threaded rod would go through.  I squeezed the nut that sits in the thrust block by first placing the rod in the nut, and then putting this through the thrust block on top of the pre-drilled frame.  This gave me a good ~8 inches or so of hole that helped align the whole mechanism as I used a mallet to force the nut into the slightly undersized hole I had drilled and chiseled out for it.  Note, don't use too much force here, the first thrust block was made of some cheap construction lumber and split during this step.  I made the second one with a piece of heavy elm.</p>
<p><img alt="thrust block as cut" src="https://indiahotelxray.github.io\photos\cider_press_thrust_block_20211220a.jpg"></p>
<p>I mounted the thrust block with six countersunk screws, pre-drilling each hole to avoid having this piece crack.</p>
<h2>Future steps</h2>
<p>I need to build the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>bucket to hold the fruit, </li>
<li>plate to apply pressure to the fruit,</li>
<li>legs to hold it upright,</li>
<li>a better handle than the piece of 2x4 that I am currently using.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For the bucket, I am planning to use some wooden staves and metal straps to strengthen a food grade plastic 5-gallon bucket with holes drilled in it to let the juice out.  I am planning to lay the staves out on a flat surface, evenly spaced over the circumfrence of the bucket, attach the upper strap with screws, and then wrap around the bucket before attaching the lower strap.  Then I will drill holes around the bottom of the bucket. I still need to figure out what will then collect the juice - I am thinking of using an old cake pan with a drain drilled at one side.</p>
<p>After I have the bucket, plate, legs, and handle done, I need to press some fruit.  I have five gallons of apples fermenting in a mini-fridge at the moment, which will be a good first test.  Following that, I know several friends with other fruits that I can use next year.</p>
